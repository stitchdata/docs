#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration connects to GitHub repositories where your Looker {{ integration.display_name }} is hosted for your Looker project. Stitch then replicates it using {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }} to extract {{ integration.display_name }} components using [lkml parser](https://github.com/joshtemple/lkml){:target="new"}.
  
  Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.


# -------------------------- #
#      Incompatibilities     #
# -------------------------- #

## uncomment section below if integration is compatible with any Stitch destinations
## if incompatible with multiple destinations, create a section for each destination

## incompatible:
  ## [redshift]: "always,sometimes,never"
  ## reason: "copy"

  - item: |
      **Access to the GitHub repositories you want to replicate data from.** Stitch will only be able to access the same repositories as the user who creates the access token.


setup-steps:
  - title: "Create access token"
    anchor: "create-access-token"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your GitHub account.
      2. Click the **User menu (your icon) > Settings**.
      3. Click **Developer settings** in the navigation on the left side of the page.
      4. Click **Personal access tokens**.
      5. On the Personal access tokens page, click the **Generate a personal access token** button. If prompted, enter your password.
      7. In the **Description** field, enter `stitch`. This will allow you to easily idenfiy what application is using the token.
      8. In the **Select Scopes** section, check the **repo** option:

         ![Highlighted repo scopes on the GitHub Personal Access Tokens page]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/github-token-scopes.png)

         **Note**: While these are full permissions, Stitch will only ever read your data. The **repo** scope is required due to how GitHub structures permissions.
      9. Click the **Generate token** button.
      10. The new access token will display on the next page. **Copy the token before navigating away from the page** - GitHub won't display it again.

  - title: "Add {{ integration.display_name }} as a Stitch data source"
    anchor: "add-stitch-data-source"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
      4. In the **API Token** field, paste the access token you copied from [step 1](#create-access-token).
      5. In the **Git Owner** field, enter the owner of the repositories you want to replicate. You can find this info in the repository's URL. For example: The Git owner of `https://github.com/stitch/stitch-repo` would be `stitch`.
         
         **Note**: While you can replicate data from multiple repositories, this integration only supports replicating from one owner at a time.
      6. In the **Git Repositories** field, enter the repository or repositories you want to replicate. You can find this info in the repository's URL. For example: The repository of `https://github.com/stitch/stitch-repo` would be `stitch-repo`.
      
         To track multiple repositories, enter them as a comma-delimited list. For example: `repo-1, repo-2`.
