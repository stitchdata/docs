  - title: "add integration"
  - title: "historical sync"
  - title: "replication frequency"
  - title: "Authorize Stitch to access {{ integration.display_name }}"
    anchor: "grant-stitch-authorization"

      1. Next, you'll be prompted to sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. A screen explaining what you're authorizing will display. **Note**: Stitch will only ever read your {{ integration.display_name }} data, and cannot create charges or any other records in {{ integration.display_name }}.
      3. Click **Sign in with {{ integration.display_name }} to connect**.
      4. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      5. After the authorization process is successfully completed, you'll be directed back to Stitch.

#     Replication Details     #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - content: |
      In the {{ integration.display_name }} API, there are two concepts:

      - **Objects**, which are items like charges, invoices, customers, etc.
      - **Events**, which are changes to objects. For example: An invoice being created, or its status going from `draft` to `open`.

      Whenever an object is created or updated in {{ integration.display_name }}, a corresponding event is created. Because {{ integration.display_name }} creates and updates object records in this way, there are two types of tables in Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration:

      - A table for **events**, which contains all events that have occurred for {{ integration.display_name }}'s [supported event types](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"}. This table acts as a history for an object record, showing how it has been changed over time.
      - Tables for **objects**, which contains the latest version of records. These are tables like [`customers`](#customers), [`charges`](#charges), [`invoices`](#invoices), etc.

      **Note**: Updates based on events is only applicable to the type of object the event is for. For example: If a dispute object is updated, only the corresponding record in the `disputes` table will be updated. The related `charge` in the `charges` table will **not** be updated. To retrieve related data for different objects, you'll need to use the `events` table. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"} for info about event types and the objects they describe.
