# -------------------------- #

## Incompatibilities with destinations are listed here.

incompatible:
  postgres: "sometimes"
  reason: "Tables and columns created as a result of de-nesting nested data may have names that exceed PostgreSQL's limit of 63 characters for tables and 59 characters for columns. PostgreSQL data warehouses will reject these tables and columns, meaning Stitch will be unable to load them."

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Administrator permissions in {{ integration.display_name }}.** This is required to grant Stitch access to {{ integration.display_name }}.

setup-steps:
  - title: "add integration"
  - title: "historical sync"
  - title: "replication frequency"
  - title: "Authorize Stitch to access {{ integration.display_name }}"
    anchor: "grant-stitch-authorization"
    content: |
      1. Next, you'll be prompted to sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. A screen explaining what you're authorizing will display. **Note**: Stitch will only ever read your {{ integration.display_name }} data, and cannot create charges or any other records in {{ integration.display_name }}.
      3. Click **Sign in with {{ integration.display_name }} to connect**.
      4. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      5. After the authorization process is successfully completed, you'll be directed back to Stitch.
      6. Click {{ app.buttons.finish-int-setup }}.

#     Replication Details     #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - content: |
      In the {{ integration.display_name }} API, there are two concepts:

      - **Objects**, which are items like charges, invoices, customers, etc.
      - **Events**, which are changes to objects. For example: An invoice being created, or its status going from `draft` to `open`.

      Whenever an object is created or updated in {{ integration.display_name }}, a corresponding event is created. Because {{ integration.display_name }} creates and updates object records in this way, there are two types of tables in Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration:

      - A table for **events**, which contains all events that have occurred for {{ integration.display_name }}'s [supported event types](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"}. This table acts as a history for an object record, showing how it has been changed over time.
      - Tables for **objects**, which contains the latest version of records. These are tables like [`customers`](#customers), [`charges`](#charges), [`invoices`](#invoices), etc.

      **Note**: Updates based on events is only applicable to the type of object the event is for. For example: If a dispute object is updated, only the corresponding record in the `disputes` table will be updated. The related `charge` in the `charges` table will **not** be updated. To retrieve related data for different objects, you'll need to use the `events` table. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"} for info about event types and the objects they describe.

          In the image below is an example of how records for the `events` and `invoices` tables will look as an invoice changes over time. **Click the image to enlarge.**
