    content: |
      When Stitch runs a replication job for {{ integration.display_name }}, a few things will happen:

      1. First, Stitch will get all the hotels that the [authenticating user](#add-stitch-data-source) has access to.
      2. Stitch will [replicate review snapshot data](#replicate-review-snapshots) (`hotel_reviews_snapshot`, `hotel_reviews_snapshot_by_site`, `hotel_reviews_snapshot_by_time`) for the hotel.
      3. Stitch will replicate data about the hotel (`hotels`).
      3. Stitch will repeat steps 2-3 until review snapshot and hotel data has been replicated for all accessible hotels.
      4. Stitch will replicate review data (`reviews`) based on the last saved `updated_at` value, which is the table's Replication Key.

  - title: "Replicating review snapshots"
    anchor: "replicate-review-snapshots"
    content: |
      When Stitch extracts review snapshot data, it will do so using an **Attribution Window** of **{{ integration.attribution-window }}**. This means that during each replication job, Stitch will replicate snapshot data for that last completed week. For example: If the integration is scheduled to run every 30 minutes, then snapshot data for the last week will be replicated every 30 minutes.

      This is applicable to the `hotel_reviews_snapshot`, `hotel_reviews_snapshot_by_site`, and `hotel_reviews_snapshot_by_time` tables.
