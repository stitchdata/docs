#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }}. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.


# -------------------------- #
#      Incompatibilities     #
# -------------------------- #

## uncomment section below if integration is compatible with any Stitch destinations
## if incompatible with multiple destinations, create a section for each destination

## incompatible:
  ## [redshift]: "always,sometimes,never"
  ## reason: "copy"

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Obtain your API key"
    anchor: "obtain-api-key"
    content: |
      1. Login to your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. In the **Developer Kit** menu, click **API Keys**.
      3. Click **Generate New Key**.
      4. Your API key will display.

      Keep this page open - you'll need it to complete the next step.
  - title: "Add {{ integration.display_name }} as a Stitch data source"
    anchor: "add-stitch-data-source"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
      4. In the **API Key** field, paste the API key you obtained in [step 1](#obtain-api-key).
  - title: "Define the historical replication start date"
    anchor: "define-historical-sync"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/saas/setup/historical-sync.html %}
  
  - title: "Create a replication schedule"
    anchor: "define-rep-frequency"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}

  - title: "Set objects to replicate"
    anchor: "setting-data-to-replicate"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/data-selection/object-selection.html %}


# -------------------------- #
#      Replication Info      #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - title: "Attribution windows and data extraction"
    anchor: "attribution-windows-data-extraction"
    content: |
      Every time Stitch runs a replication job for {{ integration.display_name }}, the last {{ integration.attribution-window }}' worth of data will be replicated for the following tables:

      {% assign all-tables = site.integration-schemas | where:"tap",integration.name %}
      {% assign all-version-tables = all-tables | where:"version",integration.this-version %}
      {% assign tables-with-attribution = all-version-tables | where:"attribution-window",true %}

      {% for table in tables-with-attribution %}
      - `{{ table.name }}` - {{ table.attribution-window-days }} days
      {% endfor %}

      Stitch replicates data in this way to account for updates made to existing records within an attribution window, thus ensuring you won’t make decisions based on stale (or false) data. As a result, you may see a higher number of replicated rows than what’s being generated in {{ integration.display_name }}.

      Setting the Replication Frequency to a higher frequency - like 30 minutes - can result in re-replicating recent data and contribute to greater row usage. Replicating fewer tables or selecting a lower frequency can help keep your row count low.

      In the sections below are examples of how attribution windows impact how Stitch extracts data during historical and ongoing replication jobs.
