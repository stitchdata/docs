      **Administrator permissions in Freshdesk.** As Stitch will only be able to replicate data that the authorizing user access to, we recommend that someone with these permissions complete the setup. For example: if the authorizing user only has access to a handful of tickets, Stitch will only be able to access and replicate the data for those tickets.

      Having a Freshdesk administrator create the integration will ensure that Stitch is able to replicate all the data in your Freshdesk account.

      1. Sign into your Freshdesk account.
      2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Profile Settings**.
      3. Your API Key will display under the **Change Password** section of your profile page.

      Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to wrap things up in Stitch.
