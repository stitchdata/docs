feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }}. Using this integration requires that the [SuiteAnalytics feature](#setup-requirements) be enabled in your NetSuite account.

  Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.

# -------------------------- #
#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: "**Administrator permissions in NetSuite.**. This is required to complete the setup steps in NetSuite."
  - item: "**Access to the SuiteAnalytics feature in NetSuite.** Suite Analytics is a premium NetSuite feature. Contact your NetSuite administrator if you have questions about this feature."

            content: |
              To discover tables and their schemas, Stitch queries the `OA_COLUMNS` system table in the [Connect Schema](https://1796361.app.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_158695828012.html){:target="new"} for the following info:

              <table class="attribute-list">
              <tr>
              <td class="attribute-name"><strong>Column name</strong></td>
              <td><strong>Description</strong></td>
              </tr>
              {% for column in sub-subsection.columns %}
              <tr>
              <td class="attribute-name"><strong>{{ column.name }}</strong></td>
              <td>{{ column.description | flatify | markdownify }}</td>
              </tr>
              {% endfor %}
              </table>

              All tables where `table_qualifer != SCHEMA` and `table_owner != SYSTEM` will be returned and displayed in Stitch as avaiilable for replication.

              Refer to [NetSuite's documentation](https://1796361.app.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_4410183892.html){:target="new"} for more info about the `OA_COLUMNS` system table.

          - title: "Identifying Primary Keys"
            anchor: "discovery--primary-keys"
            summary: "Identify Primary Keys"
            content: |
              Stitch's approach to Primary Keys for {{ integration.display_name }} is a bit different than other integrations. In {{ integration.display_name }}, we've found that some tables might not have Primary Keys at all, or Primary Key columns may sometimes contain `NULL` values.

              To determine if a table has Primary Keys, Stitch queries the `OA_FKEYS` system table. If the table has Primary Keys, Stitch will:
              
              1. Combine all Primary Key column values on a per record basis
              2. Hash the result and place the hash in a [system column]({{ link.destinations.storage.sdc-columns | prepend: site.baseurl }}) named `{{ system-column.record-hash }}`
              3. Designate `{{ system-column.record-hash }}` as the table's Primary Key. Primary Key columns will have a {{ site.data.ui.icons.primary-key | flatify }} icon next to their name in Stitch.
              4. Automatically set `{{ system-column.record-hash }}` and the table's Primary Key columns to replicate

              **Note**: The presence of Primary Keys partially determines [how data is loaded into your destination](#loading-details).

              Refer to [NetSuite's documentation](https://1796361.app.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_4410184091.html){:target="new"} for more info about the `OA_FKEYS` system table.

          - title: "Data typing"
            anchor: "discovery--data-types"
            summary: "Type the data in discovered columns"
            data-types:
              - name: "varchar2"
                stitch-type: "string"
                notes: |
                  The `VARCHAR2` data type includes `BOOLEAN` data due to how NetSuite stores these values.

                  NetSuite stores `BOOLEAN` values as `VARCHAR2` with either a length of one (`"t"` or `"f"`) or three (`"yes"` or `"no"`). As typing can't be correctly asserted based on a length of one or three, these values are dicovered as strings.
              
              - name: "number"
                stitch-type: "integer"
                notes: |
                  If the column's `oa_scale` value is `0`, Stitch will type the data as an `INTEGER`.

              - name: "number"
                stitch-type: "number"
                notes: |
                  If the column's `oa_scale` value is greater than `0`, Stitch will type the data as a `NUMBER`.
              
              - name: "timestamp"
                stitch-type: "string (date-time)"
                notes: |
                  Stitch will type `TIMESTAMP` data as a `DATE-TIME`-formatted string.
            content: |
              Next, Stitch will assign data types to columns. To determine data types, Stitch uses the `type_name` and `oa_scale` columns returned from the `OA_COLUMNS` system table [during table discovery](#discovery--objects).

              In the following table:

              - **NetSuite data type**: The data type in NetSuite, based on the column's `type_name` value.
              - **Stitch data type**: The Stitch data type the NetSuite type will be mapped to.
              - **Description:** Details about the data type or mapping.

              <table class="attribute-list">
              <tr>
              <td class="attribute-name">

              </table>

      - title: "Data replication"
        anchor: "extraction--data-replication"
        summary: "Select records for replication"
        content: |
          After discovery is completed, Stitch will move onto extracting data. The [Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) Stitch uses is dependent on whether the table contains valid [Replication Key columns]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

          Stitch will default to using [Key-based Incremental Replication]({{ link.replication.key-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) if a table contains any of the following columns:

          - `last_modified_date`
          - `date_last_modified`
          - `date_deleted`
          - `date_last_modified_gmt` (`transaction_lines` table only)

          If a table contains more than one of the above columns, you'll be prompted to select a column to use as a Replication Key when you set the table to replicate. Otherwise, Stitch will use the single column as the Replication Key for the table.

          If a table doesn't contain any of the above columns, Stitch will default to using [Full Table Replication]({{ link.replication.full-table | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

          As this integration supports configuring Replication Methods, you can toggle between Replication Methods for tables on the **Table Settings** page in Stitch.

  - title: "Loading"
    anchor: "loading-details"
    summary: "Details about how data replicated from {{ integration.display_name }} is loaded into a destination"
    content: |
      How data replicated from an {{ integration.display_name }} integration is loaded into your destination depends on two factors:

      1. **If the table has Primary Keys** identified [during discovery](#discovery--primary-keys).

      2. **If your destination supports upserts, or updating existing rows**. For destinations that support upserts, Stitch uses Primary Keys to de-dupe data during loading. {{ site.data.tooltips.primary-key }}

         **Note**: For Append-Only destinations, data will be loaded in an Append-Only manner regardless of whether a table has Primary Keys.

    subsections:
      - title: "Loading with Primary Keys"
        anchor: "loading--with-primary-keys"
        content: |
          If the destination supports upserts and the table has Primary Keys, Stitch will de-dupe records using `{{ system-column.record-hash }}` as the Primary Key.

          This means that existing rows will be overwritten with the most recent version of the row. A record can only have a single unique Primary Key value, ensuring that only one version of the record exists in the destination at a time.

      - title: "Loading without Primary Keys"
        anchor: "loading--without-primary-keys"
        content: |
          If the destination is Append-Only, or if the table doesn't have Primary Keys, data will be loaded in an Append-Only manner.

          This means that existing rows will never be updated with new data. New and updated records will be appended to the end of the table as new rows.

          **Note**: Querying Append-Only tables requires a different strategy than you might normally use. For instructions and a sample query, check out the [Querying Append-Only tables guide]({{ link.replication.append-only-querying | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

# Looking for the table schemas & info?
# Each table has a its own .md file in /_integration-schemas/netsuite-analytics/v1

append-only-loading: |
  **Note**: As this table doesn't have a Primary Key, data will be loaded using [Append-Only loading]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) even if your destination supports and is configured to use Upserts.

netsuite-primary-keys: |
  {% assign netsuite-pks = table.attributes | where:"netsuite-primary-key",true %}

  NetSuite designates the following columns as Primary Keys for this table:

  {% for pk in netsuite-pks %}
  - `{{ pk.name }}`
  {% endfor %}

netsuite-primary-key-description: "**Note**: This column is used to create the `{{ system-column.record-hash }}` value."

netsuite-replication-keys: |
  {% assign netsuite-rks = table.attributes | where:"replication-key",true %}

  If you set this table to replicate and select Key-based Incremental Replication, you'll need to also select a Replication Key.

  There are multiple possible Replication Keys for this table:

  {% for rk in netsuite-rks %}
  - `{{ rk.name }}`
  {% endfor %}
