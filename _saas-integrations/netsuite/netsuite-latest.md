         {% endfor %}
      3. Click **Save**.

  - title: "Create a Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} role"
    anchor: "create-stitch-netsuite-role"
    content: |
      To connect {{ integration.display_name }} to Stitch, we recommend that you create a Stitch-specific role and user for us. We suggest this to ensure that:

      1. Stitch is easily distinguishable in any logs or audits.

      2. Stitch doesn't encounter issues with replication due to {{ integration.display_name }}'s API limitations. Currently, a single {{ integration.display_name }} user is allowed to only have a single open API session at a time. If the user connected to Stitch has another connection elsewhere, replication problems will arise.

      3. Stitch can successfully authenticate to {{ integration.display_name }}. This will require creating a role that mirrors the standard {{ integration.display_name }} [Full Access Role](https://system.netsuite.com/app/help/helpcenter.nl?fid=section_N295396.html){:target="new"}.

         **Note**: Using the Full Access role requires two-factor authentication, which Stitch's integration doesn't currently support. For this reason, **do not assign the actual Full Access role to the Stitch user.**

    substeps:
      - title: "Create the new role"
        anchor: "create-the-new-role"
        content: |
          {% capture two-factor-auth-roles %}
          {{ integration.display_name }} enforces two-factor authentication for Full Access and Administrator roles as of {{ integration.display_name }} 2018.1.

          Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration can't authenticate using this method. Connection errors will arise if either the Full Access or Administrator role is assigned to the Stitch user.
          {% endcapture %}

          {% include important.html first-line="**Do not assign the Full Access or Administrator role to Stitch**" content=two-factor-auth-roles %}

          To ensure Stitch can access and replicate all NetSuite objects supported for replication, you'll need to create a role to assign to the Stitch user.

          1. In your {{ integration.display_name }} account, click **Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Roles > New**.
          2. On the Role page, enter a name for the role in the **Name** field. For example: `Stitch`

      - title: "Grant permissions to the role"
        anchor: "grant-permissions-to-role"
        content: |
          Next, you'll grant permissions to the role. Below are instructions for adding permissions to the role, the permissions required, and where to find them in {{ integration.display_name }}.

          In {{ integration.display_name }}, the Create Role **Permissions** section contains several subsections. In this guide is a tab that corresponds to the permissions you need to add in each {{ integration.display_name }} subsection. For example: In the **Permissions > Transactions** subsection, you'll add the permissions outlined in the **Transactions** tab of this guide.

          {% capture adding-permission-instructions %}
          **Refer to the other tabs in this section of the guide for the permissions you need to add**. 

          To add a permission to the role:

          1. In the **Permissions** section, click a subsection. For example: **Transactions**
          2. Using the **Permission** dropdown, search for the permission you want to add.

             For example: If adding permissions in the **Transactions** subtab of {{ integration.display_name }}, you'll use the checklist in the **Transactions** tab of this guide.
          3. Using the **Level** dropdown, set the permission level to the corresponding level outlined in this guide:

             ![The Transactions subsection in the Permissions section of the NetSuite Create Role page]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/netsuite-role-permissions-tab.png)
          4. Click **Add**.
          5. Repeat these steps until all permissions in the tabs of this guide have been added.

      - title: "Save the role and retrieve its internal ID"
        anchor: "save-role-retrieve-id"
        content: |
          After you've finished granting permissions to the role, click **Save** to create the it.

          Next, you'll retrieve the role's internal ID. Stitch requires this ID to successfully create your {{ integration.display_name }} integration.

          If you've just saved the role, you should automatically be redirected to the **Manage Roles** page. If not, you can access this page by clicking **Setup > Users/Roles > Manage Roles**.

          Locate the role you just created. The ID is located in a column called **Internal ID**:

          ![The Internal ID column contains the user's Role ID.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/netsuite-locate-role-id.png)

          If you don't see the Internal ID column in the list, you may need to add it:

          1. Click the **Edit View** button.
          2. Click the drop-down menu and select **Internal ID**.
          3. Click **Add**.
          4. Click **Save**.

          After you add the column to the Roles list, locate the ID for the role. Keep this handy - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.
        
  - title: "Create the Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} user"
    anchor: "create-stitch-netsuite-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated {{ integration.display_name }} user for Stitch and assign the Stitch role to it.

      1. In your NetSuite account, click **Lists > Employees > Employees > New**.
      2. In the Employee page, fill in the **Name** and **Email** fields.
      3. Next, click the **Access** tab.
      4. In the **Access** tab:

         1. Create a password for the Stitch user. Enter it in the **Password** field, then again in the **Confirm Password** field.
         2. In the **Roles** section, search the dropdown menu to locate the Stitch role you created in [Step 3](#create-stitch-netsuite-role).
         3. Click **Add** once you've located the role.
      5. When finished, click **Save**.

  - title: "Locate your {{ integration.display_name }} Account ID"
    anchor: "locate-netsuite-account-id"
    content: |
      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/netsuite-account-id.png" alt="" max-width="250px" %}
      Click **Setup > Integration Web Services Preferences**.
      
      In the Primary Information section, locate the **Account ID** field as shown in the image on the right.
      
      **Note**: If your Account ID contains a suffix - `1234567_SB2`, for example - it should be included when entering the ID into Stitch.

  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. Enter the email address and password associated with the Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} user.
      5. Enter the **Role ID** you retrieved in [Step 3.3](#save-role-retrieve-id). **Note**: This must be the numerical ID, not the name of the role. See [Step 3.3](#save-role-retrieve-id) if you need help locating the user's Role ID.
      6. In the **Account ID** field, enter the Account ID you retrieved in [Step 5](#locate-netsuite-account-id).
      6. Select the **Account Type** - Production or Sandbox.

#     Integration Tables     #
# --------------------------#

schema-sections:
  - title: "Deleted records"
    anchor: "using-netsuite-deleted"
    content: |
      Stitch's NetSuite integration includes a table called `netsuite_deleted`; this table contains a row for **every deleted record that supports deletes**. Accounting for deleted records is especially important if you’re performing any sort of aggregate function - for example, totaling invoices or balancing your books.

      For this reason, we recommend setting this table to replicate.
    subsections:
      - title: "netsuite_deleted Table Schema"
        anchor: "netsuite-deleted-table-schema"
        content: |
          The attributes of the `netsuite_deleted` table include:

          - **type**: This indicates the **type** of record. For example: invoice.
          - **name**: This is the name of the record. For example: `Invoice #INV197`
          - **deletedDate:** The date the record was deleted.
          - **customRecord:** This indicates if the record was a custom record.
          - **internalId:** This is the numerical ID of the record.

          Custom records will look a little different than other records. In this case, you'll see the following:

          - **type**: This column will contain a **numerical ID**.
          - **name** and **internalId**: The `internalId` of the record will display in **both** columns.
          - **customRecord**: This column will contain a `true` value.

          For example: The first two records in this table are "normal" records, while the third is a custom record:

          | type         | internalId | name             | customRecord | deletedDate                   |
          |--------------+------------+------------------+--------------+-------------------------------|
          | invoice      | 124831     | Invoice #INV197  | false        | 2016-08-02T09:33:07.000-07:00 |
          | journalEntry | 111366     | Journal #JV13526 | false        | 2016-08-04T12:01:22.000-07:00 |
          | 19           | 128        | 128              | true         | 2016-07-21T12:05:26.000-07:00 |

      - title: "Accounting for deleted records"
        anchor: "accounting-record-deletes"
        content: |
          To account for deleted records, you can use a `LEFT JOIN` to tie deleted records back to the appropriate table.

          For example: The following query would return all invoice records that exist in the `netsuite_transaction` and `netsuite_deleted` tables:

          ```sql
             SELECT * 
               FROM netsuite_transactions tran 
          LEFT JOIN netsuite_deleted del
                 ON tran.internalId = del.internalId 
                AND tran.type = 'invoice'
                AND del.type = 'invoice'
          ```

          If you're using a data warehouse that is **case-insensitive** (like Redshift), some queries may result in errors. If this occurs, try using `LOWER` to resolve the issue:

          ```sql
             SELECT *
               FROM netsuite_transactions tran 
          LEFT JOIN netsuite_deleted del 
                 ON tran.internalId = del.internalId 
          AND LOWER(tran.type) = LOWER(del.type)
          ```

          To filter out deleted records from other data, you can run a query like this one:

          ```sql
             SELECT *
               FROM netsuite_transactions tran 
          LEFT JOIN netsuite_deleted del
                 ON tran.internalId = del.internalId 
          AND LOWER(tran.type) = LOWER(del.type) 
              WHERE del.deletedDate is null;
          ```
  - title: "Supported transaction types"
    anchor: "transaction-types"
    content: |
      The following table contains the transaction types Stitch's NetSuite integration currently supports.

      {% assign all-tables = site.integration-schemas | where:"tap",integration.name %}
      {% assign transaction-table = all-tables | where:"name","netsuite_transaction" %}

      <table class="attribute-list">
      {% for table in transaction-table %}
      {% for transaction-type in table.supported-types %}
      {% cycle 'before': '<tr>', '', '', '' %}
      <td>
      {{ transaction-type.name }}
      </td>
      {% if forloop.last %}
      <td>
      </td>
      <td>
      </td>
      </tr>
      {% else %}
      {% cycle 'after': '', '', '', '</tr>' %}
      {% endif %}
      {% endfor %}
      {% endfor %}
