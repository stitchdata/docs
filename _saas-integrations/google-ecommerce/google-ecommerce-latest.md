#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **At least Read & Analyze permissions in the account you want to connect to Stitch**. [See Google's documentation for more info](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495?hl=en){:target="new"}.

  - item: "**To have recent data in the account you want to connect to Stitch.** Verify that there is data from the past 30 days in the account before continuing."

  - item: "**To pause all ad-blocking software**. Because Google authentication uses pop ups, you may encounter issues if ad blockers aren't disabled during the setup."

  - item: |
      **To enable the [Enable ECommerce](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1009612?hl=en){:target="new"} setting in your Google Analytics account.** If you have ECommerce data in your account, this setting is already enabled and you can move on.

      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Google account and to approve Stitch’s access to your {{ integration.display_name }} data. **Note that we will only ever read your data.**
      2. Click **Allow** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the Google Analytics profile you want to connect to Stitch:

         ![Selecting a Google Analytics profile.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/integrations/ga-select-profiles.png)

         **Remember:** Profiles need to have Read & Analyze permissions to be detected by Stitch. If you don’t see the profile you want in this list, we recommend that you double-check the permission settings.
      4. When finished, click **Continue** to save the integration and complete the setup.

# Looking for the table schemas & info?
# Each table has a its own .md file in /_integration-schemas/google-ecommerce

schema-sections:
  - content: |
      After the first successful sync of your {{ integration.display_name }} data, you'll see a single table in your data warehouse. The table follows this naming convention:

      `ecommerce[GA profile id]_integration version`

      For example: `ecommerce123456789_v2`. In this case, the profile ID is `123456789` and the version of the ECommerce integration is `2`.
