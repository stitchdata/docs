      ### Replication
      Because of how Mixpanel's API is designed, this table can only be queried by day. This means that every time Stitch runs a replication job for a Mixpanel integration, **the past day's worth of data will be replicated for this table.**

    primary-key: "event:time:distinct_id:_rjm_record_hash"

      1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. Click **Account**, which is located in the upper right portion of the screen.

#      Replication Info      #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - content: |
      Because of how Mixpanel's API is designed, two of the three tables in the {{ integration.display_name }} integration - the `mixpanel_export` and `mixpanel_funnels` tables - can only be queried by day. 

      This means that every time Stitch runs a replication job for a Mixpanel integration, the past day's worth of data will be replicated for each of these tables.

      To prevent the re-replication of data that will count against your row count, we recommend setting the Replication Frequency to something less frequent.
