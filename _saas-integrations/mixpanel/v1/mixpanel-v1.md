#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }}. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.


# -------------------------- #
#      Incompatibilities     #
# -------------------------- #

## uncomment section below if integration is compatible with any Stitch destinations
## if incompatible with multiple destinations, create a section for each destination

## incompatible:
  ## [redshift]: "always,sometimes,never"
  ## reason: "copy"

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Admin privileges**. These are required to retrieve your API secret in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Retrieve your {{ integration.display_name }} project timezone and API secret"
    anchor: "retrieve-timezone-api-secret"
    content: |
      1. Login to your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. In the dropdown menu in the upper left corner of the page, select the project you want to replicate data from.
      3. Hover over the **Settings** icon in the upper right corner. In the **PROJECT SETTINGS** portion of the dropdown menu, click on the link with the name of your project.
      4. Copy the **Project Timezone** and **API Secret**, and paste those values someplace safe to use for the next step.

  - title: "Add {{ integration.display_name }} as a Stitch data source"
    anchor: "add-stitch-data-source"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
      4. In the **API Secret** field, paste the **API Secret** you retrieved from [Step 1](#retrieve-timezone-api-secret).
      5. In the **Attribution Window** field, enter the number of days you want your tables' attribution window to be. For more information on attribution windows, refer to the [Replication section](#attribution-windows-extraction).
      6. In the **Date Window Size** field, enter the number of days desired for a date looping window for the `exports`, `funnels`, and `revenues` tables.

         Date looping will return records whose `from_date` and `to_date` fall between the number of days in the defined window size.

         **Note**: If your project has large volumes of events, you may want to set the number of days to `14`, `7`, or even to `1` or `2` days.
      7. **Optional**: To fetch specific events, enter a comma-separated list of events in the **Export Events** field. For example: `Page Viewed, Signed Up`.
      8. In the **Project Timezone** field, paste the **Project Timezone** you retrieved from [Step 1](#retrieve-timezone-api-secret).
      9. **Optional**: To capture new properties automatically in the `events` and `engage` tables, check the **Select Properties By Default** box. Otherwise, new properties will be ignored.

## Max start date: https://github.com/singer-io/tap-mixpanel/blob/master/tap_mixpanel/sync.py#L151
  - anchor: "define-historical-sync"
    content: |
      {% capture step-content %}
      **Note**: {{ integration.display_name }} limits the number of days historical data may be accessed, depending on your {{ integration.display_name }} plan. If you select a Start Date greater than what your {{ integration.display_name }} account has access to, Stitch may encounter issues with {{ integration.display_name }}'s API.
      
      For example: If you have a Starter Free {{ integration.display_name }} plan, you have access to 90 days of historical data (as of 06/5/2020). If you select a Start Date greater than 90 days, {{ integration.display_name }}'s API may return an error.

      Additionally, the Start Date must be less than or equal to **365 days**. If a Start Date greater than 365 days is selected, Stitch will reset the Start Date to 365 days during Extraction.
      
      Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004511246){:target="new"} for more info and to check your {{ integration.display_name }} account's historical data access limit.

#      Replication Info      #
# -------------------------- #

  - title: "Attribution windows and data extraction"
    anchor: "attribution-windows-extraction"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="The info in this section only applies to tables using Key-based Incremental Replication. Tables using Full Table Replication replicate fully during each replication job and don't use attribution windows." %}

      When Stitch runs a replication job for {{ integration.display_name }}, it will use the value of the **Attribution Window** setting to query for and extract data for tables using Key-based Incremental Replication. An attribution window is a period of time for attributing results to ads and the lookback period after those actions occur during which ad results are counted.

      For example: If set to **5 days**, Stitch will replicate the past five days' worth of data for applicable tables every time a replication job runs. While Stitch replicates data in this way to account for updates to records made during the attribution window, it can have a [substantial impact on your overall row usage](#attribution-window-row-count-impact).

      **Note**: If the beginning of the attribution window is earlier than the selected Start Date, the replication will start from the Start Date and no data before that date will be fetched. For example, if you set the Start Date to five days ago and the attribution window to ten days, only the past five days' worth of data will be replicated.

      In the sections below are examples of how attribution windows impact how Stitch extracts data during historical and ongoing replication jobs.

      {% include integrations/saas/ads-append-only-replication.html %}
      {% include integrations/saas/attribution-window-examples.html %}

    subsections:
      - title: "Attribution windows and row count impact"
        anchor: "attribution-window-row-count-impact"
        content: |
          Due to the Attribution Window, a high Replication Frequency may not be necessary. Because Stitch will replicate data from the past `N` days during every replication job, recent data will be re-replicated and count towards your row quota.

          To reduce your row usage and replicating redundant data, consider setting the integration to replicate less frequently. For example: every 12 or 24 hours.

  - title: "Hidden fields in Mixpanel"
    anchor: "hidden-fields"
    content: |
      The Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} integration is not able to discover fields marked as hidden in your {{ integration.display_name }} account. To ensure the fields you want replicated will be available in Stitch, double-check that they aren't hidden in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
