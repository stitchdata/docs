      ### Replication
      Because of how Mixpanel's API is designed, this table can only be queried by day. This means that every time Stitch runs a replication job for a Mixpanel integration, **the past day's worth of data will be replicated for this table.**
    replication-method: "Key-based Incremental"
    primary-key: "event:time:distinct_id:_rjm_record_hash"
    nested-structures: false
    attributes:
      - name: distinct_id

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Retrieve your {{ integration.display_name }} API credentials"
    anchor: "retrieve-mixpanel-api-creds"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. Click **Account**, which is located in the upper right portion of the screen.
      3. In the modal that displays, click **Projects**. 

         **Note**: This window is different than the Project Settings window, which is accessed using the gear icon in the lower left corner. **The window you need can be accessed only by clicking Account > Projects**.
      4. Your API credentials will display:

         ![Mixpanel API credentials.]({{ site.baseurl}}/images/integrations/mixpanel-api-creds.png)

         Leave this page open - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.
  - title: "Add {{ integration.display_name }} as a Stitch data source"
    anchor: "add-stitch-data-source"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
      4. Paste your API credentials in the the **API Key** and **Secret** fields, respectively.
  - title: "Define the historical sync"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/saas/setup/historical-sync.html %}
      
      **Note**: {{ integration.display_name }} limits the number of days historical data may be accessed, depending on your {{ integration.display_name }} plan. If you select a Start Date greater than what your {{ integration.display_name }} account has access to, the {{ integration.display_name }} API will return an error and prevent Stitch from extracting data.
      
      For example: If you have a Starter Free {{ integration.display_name }} plan, you have access to 90 days of historical data (as of 04/28/2020). If you select a Start Date greater than 90 days, {{ integration.display_name }}'s API will prevent Stitch from extracting your data.
      
      Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004511246){:target="new"} for more info and to check your {{ integration.display_name }} account's historical data access limit.
  
  - title: "Create a replication schedule"
    anchor: "define-rep-frequency"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}

  - title: "Set objects to replicate"
    anchor: "setting-data-to-replicate"

#      Replication Info      #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - content: |
      Because of how Mixpanel's API is designed, two of the three tables in the {{ integration.display_name }} integration - the `mixpanel_export` and `mixpanel_funnels` tables - can only be queried by day. 

      This means that every time Stitch runs a replication job for a Mixpanel integration, the past day's worth of data will be replicated for each of these tables.

      To prevent the re-replication of data that will count against your row count, we recommend setting the Replication Frequency to something less frequent.
