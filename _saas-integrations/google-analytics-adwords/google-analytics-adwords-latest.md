  This guide describes how to replicate Google AdWords data using Stitch's Google Analytics integration. Additionally, this approach replaces the [deprecated 15-10-2015 version of Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/{{ integration.name }}-v15-10-2015).

  As this approach uses the Analytics API, there may be some differences in the data when compared between AdWords and Analytics. You can find out more about these differences in [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1034383?hl=en).

  If you want to use the AdWords API, use Stitch's [Google AdWords integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/google-adwords).

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: "**At least Read & Analyze permissions in the account you want to connect to Stitch**. [See Google's documentation for more info](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495?hl=en)."
  - item: "**To have recent data in the account you want to connect to Stitch.** Verify that there is data from the past 30 days in the account before continuing."
  - item: "**To link your AdWords and Google Analytics profiles.** [See Google's documentation for instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/1033961?hl=en)."
  - item: "**To pause any ad-blocking software**. Ad blockers can interfere with pop-ups, which are used in Google authorization and may prevent authorization from successfully completing."

  - title: "replication frequency"
  - title: "Authorize Stitch & Select a {{ integration.display_name }} profile"
    anchor: "auth-select-ga-profiles"
    content: |
      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Google account and to approve Stitch’s access to your Google AdWords data.
      2. Click **Allow** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the Google Analytics profile you want to connect to Stitch:

         ![Selecting a Google Analytics profile.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/integrations/ga-select-profiles.png)

         **Remember**: Profiles need to have Read & Analyze permissions to be detected by Stitch. If you don’t see the profile you want in this list, double-check the permission settings of the profile.
      4. When finished, click **Continue** to save the integration.
  - title: "Select Metrics and Dimensions"
    anchor: "select-metrics-and-dimensions"
    content: |
      After you grant Stitch access to your Google Analytics profile, you can select {{ integration.display_name }} Metrics and Dimensions you want to replicate to your destination.

      Before you make your selections, note that:

      - **The following instructions use the Metrics and Dimensions that a deprecated version of Stitch's Google AdWords integration replicated**. You can select other Metrics or Dimensions, but we're listing them here for those who may want to mimic the old integration.

      - **Metric/Dimension combinations must comply with Google's compatibility rules before the integration can be saved**. Stitch will check the validity of your selections as you go and notify you if something isn't allowed. [Google's Dimensions & Metrics Explorer](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#cats=adwords) can be used to validate different combinations before you enter them in Stitch.

      - **Google limits the number of Metrics and Dimensions you can select.** You can select up to 10 Metrics and seven Dimensions per integration. Refer to [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#metrics) for more info on these limits.

      - **Metric/Dimension combinations can't be changed after the integration is saved**. The Primary Key Stitch will create is a composite key composed of the Dimensions selected during this step.

      Refer to [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#view=detail&group=adwords) for more info about Google AdWords Metrics and Dimensions.

      #### Choose Your Data

      To complete the setup, you'll select the Metrics and Dimensions you want to replicate.

      1. In the **Choose Metrics** field, select up to 10 Metrics to replicate.

         If you want to replicate the same Metrics as [Stitch's old Google AdWords integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/{{ integration.name }}/v1), select the following:

         - `ga:adClicks`
         - `ga:adCost`
         - `ga:impressions`

      2. In the **Choose Dimensions** field, select up to seven Dimensions to replicate.

         If you want to replicate the same Dimensions as [Stitch's old Google AdWords integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/{{ integration.name }}/v1), select the following:

         - `ga:adContent`
         - `ga:adGroup`
         - `ga:adDestinationUrl`
         - `ga:adwordsCampaignID`
         - `ga:campaign`
         - `ga:date`
         - `ga:keyword`

      3. As you add Metrics and Dimensions, Stitch will check them for recent data and compatibility according to [Google's compatibility rules](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets#cats=adwords). To be considered recent, data must be from the past 30 days.
      4. Review your selections. **Remember**: Metrics/Dimensions cannot be added or removed after the integration is saved.
      5. When finished, click {{ app.buttons.save-int-settings }}.
