      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Google account and to approve Stitch’s access to your Google AdWords data. **Note that we will only ever read your data.**
      2. Click **Allow** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the Google Analytics profile you want to connect to Stitch:

         ![Selecting a Google Analytics profile.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/integrations/ga-select-profiles.png)

         **Remember: profiles need to have Read & Analyze permissions to be detected by Stitch.** If you don’t see the profile you want in this list, we recommend that you double-check the permission settings.
      4. When finished, click **Continue** to save the integration.

schema-sections:
  - title: 
    content: |
      After the first successful sync of your {{ integration.display_name }} data, you'll see two tables in your destination. These tables follow this naming convention:

      `adwords[GA profile id]_integration version`

      For example: `adwords123456789_v2`. In this case, the profile ID is `123456789` and the version of the AdWords integration is `2`.

      In the section below, you'll find a list of the attributes in these tables, a brief description, and links to Google's more in-depth documentation.

  - title: "Campaign Names and Primary Keys"
    anchor: "campaign-names-primary-keys"
    content: |
      Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration uses the campaign name (`campaign`) as part of the Primary Key for both the `adwords` and `campaign` tables. Because of this, **changing campaign names may lead to data discrepancies**.

      To account for the name change and resolve any data discrepancies, take the following steps:

      1. **Delete the affected AdWords data from your destination**. Feel free to delete the data back to the date of the earliest campaign which was renamed.
      2. **Re-replicate your AdWords data by [following these instructions]({{ link.replication.saas-historical | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#after-the-initial-setup" }})**, setting the start date back to the date of the earliest campaign which was renamed. This will reset the integration's Replication Keys and re-replicate all data back to the integration's defined Start Date.
