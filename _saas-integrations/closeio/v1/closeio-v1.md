replication-sections:
  - title: "Replicating activity data"
    anchor: "replicate-activity-data"
    content: |
      {% assign window = "Attribution Window" %}
      {% assign table = "activities" %}
      {% assign replication-key = "date_created" %}
      {% assign start-date ="07/03/2017" %}
      {% assign replication-key-historical = "2017-07-02 00:00:00" %}
      {% assign replication-key-ongoing = "2017-09-30 00:00:00" %}

      {% capture reason %}
      As {{ integration.display_name }} doesn't currently provide a way to query for activities based on modification time, Stitch replicates data in this way to ensure updated activities are captured. A list of available querying methods can be found in [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://developer.close.io/#activities-list-or-filter-all-activity-types){:target="new"}.
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include integrations/saas/attribution-windows.html attribution-reason=reason%}

      Refer to the documentation for each of these tables in the next section for more info.

      #### Attribution window examples

      In the tabs below are examples of attribution windows behave during historical (initial) and ongoing replication jobs.

      {% include integrations/saas/attribution-window-examples.html %}

  - title: "Historical event log data limitations"
    anchor: "historical-event-log-data"
    content: |
      Due to how {{ integration.display_name }}'s API functions, [only 30 days of historical data is available for event logs](https://developer.close.io/#event-log){:target="new"}:

      > Most actions in Close.io that change an object are logged in the event log. For example, creating a lead, sending an email, or deleting a note will create an event log entry. The event log API allows you to access these events, up to 30 days back in history.

      This means that despite what the integration's **Start Date** is set to, Stitch will only be able to retrieve 30 days of historical data **from the connection date** for the `event_log` table.

      Additionally, note that if you ever [reset the integration]({{ link.replication.saas-historical | prepend: site.baseurl }}), this will also apply to the date the integration is reset.
