  - item: "**Admin permissions in Marketo.** Marketo Admin permissions are required to complete portions of the setup process."

requirements-info: |
  Prior to set up, we recommend that you monitor your **Marketo API call usage** if other applications are also connected to your Marketo account. While Stitch is designed to use only a portion of your allotted API calls, replication may be impacted if numerous applications are using the API.

  See the [Replication section](#replication) for more details.

  - title: "Create an API-Only User Role in Marketo"
    anchor: "create-api-only-user-role"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="first-line" content="If you have an [API-Only User Role](http://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Create+an+API+Only+User+Role) in your Marketo account, [skip to the next section](#create-stitch-marketo-api-user)." %}

      1. Sign into your Marketo account.
      2. Click the **Admin** option.
      3. Under Admin, open the **Security** menu.

    content: |
      Next, [you’ll create an API User](http://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Create+an+API+Only+User) for Stitch. Creating a Stitch-specific user will ensure that Stitch is easily distinguishable in any logs or audits.

      1. Click the **Admin** option.

      3. Click **Users & Roles**.

      8. Click **Next**.
      9. In the **MESSAGE** section, click the **Send** button to create the user.

  - title: "Create an API Custom Service in Marketo"
    anchor: "create-api-custom-service"
    content: |
      To generate the API credentials you need to connect Stitch to Marketo, you need to [create an API Custom Service](http://docs.marketo.com/display/public/DOCS/Create+a+Custom+Service+for+Use+with+ReST+API) and associate it with the Stitch API user.

      1. In **Admin**, open the **Integration** menu.
      2. Click **LaunchPoint**.
      3. Click **New** and then **New Service**.
      4. In the New Service window, do the following:
         - **Display Name** - Enter "Stitch".
         - **Service** - Select **Custom** from the dropdown.
         - **Description** - Enter a description.
         - **API Only User** - Select the Stitch user you created.
      5. Click **Create**.
      6. After the service is created, it’ll display in the Installed Services grid. Click the **View Details** link to display your API credentials.
      7. Copy the **Client ID** and **Secret** into a text file.

  - title: "Whitelist Stitch's IP Addresses in Marketo"
    anchor: "whitelist-stitch-ips"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Completing this step is required only if you have IP Restriction enabled in Marketo.** You can check if this setting is enabled by clicking **Admin > Web Services** and looking in the **IP Restrictions** section.

      3. In the **Allowed Addresses** field, paste one of the IP addresses listed below and then click **Add**.

         {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
         - {{ ip-address.ip }}
         {% endfor %}

      4. Repeat step 4 until all the Stitch IP addresses are added.
      5. Click the **Save** button.

      Leave the Web Services page open - you’ll need it in the next step.

  - title: "Retrieve Your Marketo REST API Base URLs"
    anchor: "retrieve-marketo-base-urls"
    content: |
      1. On the Web Services page, scroll down to the **REST API** section.
      2. In this section, find the **Endpoint** and **Identity** fields.
      3. Copy these URLs into the text file where you have your Client ID and Client Secret.

replication-sections:
  - title: "Stitch & Marketo Daily API Call Limits"
    anchor: "marketo-daily-api-call-limits"
    content: |
      By default, all Marketo accounts have a maximum number of 10,000 daily account calls. Stitch's Marketo integration is designed to use up to 8,000 of these calls per day to allow other applications API access to your Marketo account.

      When the 10,000 account call limit has been reached, Stitch will be unable to replicate any Marketo data until more API quota is available. If you find that the 10,000 call limit isn't enough, **contact Marketo support** to inquire about raising the limit.
