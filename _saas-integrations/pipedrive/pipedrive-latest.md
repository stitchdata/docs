{% assign integration = page %}
{% include misc/data-files.html %}



{% contentfor setup %}
Connecting your Pipedrive data to Stitch is a five-step process:

1. [Create a Stitch Pipedrive user](#create-stitch-pipedrive-user)
2. [Retrieve your Pipedrive API token](#retrieve-pipedrive-api-token)
3. [Add Pipedrive as a Stitch data source](#add-stitch-data-source)
4. [Define the Historical Sync](#define-historical-sync)
5. [Define the Replication Frequency](#define-rep-frequency)

### Creating a Stitch Pipedrive User {#create-stitch-pipedrive-user}

To ensure Stitch can access and replicate all your data, the Pipedrive credentials you use to connect to Stitch need **Admin permissions**. We recommend that you [create a separate Pipedrive Admin user for Stitch](http://support.pipedrive.com/hc/en-us/articles/207319685-How-to-add-edit-remove-a-user), but this isnâ€™t mandatory to use the integration. Creating a user for us simply makes our activity easier to distinguish in logs and audits.

**If you donâ€™t want to create a user for us**, simply ensure that the credentials you use to connect to Stitch have Admin permissions. If the API token associated with a non-Admin user is used to set up the integration, Stitch may be unable to access and replicate all of your data.

Note that users are counted at the account-level in Pipedrive, not the company level. If you want to create a user for us and are concerned about the cost of your Pipedrive subscription, donâ€™t worry - you wonâ€™t be charged twice.

#### Connecting Multiple Pipedrive Companies

If you want to connect more than one Pipedrive company to Stitch, youâ€™ll have to repeat the entire process in this article for **each** company you want to add. Essentially, youâ€™ll have to create a separate Pipedrive integration for each company.

Our Pipedrive integration uses an API Token to authenticate. **Pipedrive API tokens are unique not only at the user level, but the company level as well**. This means that a userâ€™s API Token will vary from company to company, even if everything is housed in the same Pipedrive account.

### Retrieving Your Pipedrive API Token {#retrieve-pipedrive-api-token}

1. If you created a Pipedrive user for Stitch, sign into Pipedrive as the Stitch user.

   If you didnâ€™t, sign into Pipedrive as an Admin user.
2. Click the **user menu** (where your avatar is) in the top right corner of the screen.
3. Click **Settings**.
4. In the settings menu, click **API**.
5. The userâ€™s API Token will display.

Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.

{% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
4. Paste the Pipedrive API Token into the **API Token** field.

{% include integrations/saas/setup/historical-sync.html %}

{% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}

{% include integrations/shared-setup/initial-syncs.html %}
{% endcontentfor %}



{% contentfor schema-notes %}
Want to check out what your data looks like in Pipedrive's API? If you still have your API Token handy, you can enter it on Pipedriveâ€™s website to interact directly with the API and see your data in raw JSON format.

In the **Attributes** section for each table is a link to Pipedrive's documentation for that endpoint. Use those links to interact with Pipedrive's API.
