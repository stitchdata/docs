#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **A Google BigQuery and {{ integration.display_name }} account**. You need to have your BigQuery account configured to export to {{ integration.display_name }}. To learn how to configure this export, use [Google's step-by-step instructions](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3416092?hl=en&ref_topic=3416089){:target="new"}.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Locate your Project ID and Dataset ID"
    anchor: "retrieve-project-dataset-ids"
    content: |
      1. Login to Google and go to your Google Cloud Console.
      2. To locate your list of projects, click on the navigation menu in the upper left-hand corner of the page.
      3. Hover over **IAM & Admin** to pop open its menu. Select **Manage Resources**.
      4. On this page, navigate to the project that includes the dataset you want to replicate data from and click on it.
      5. Your **Project ID** and all of your **Dataset IDs** will be visible. Make note of the Project ID and Dataset ID that you want to replicate and keep it readily available for the {{ integration.display_name }} integration configuration page.

      4. In the **GA 360 Dataset ID** and **GA 360 Project ID** fields, enter the Project and Dataset IDs you retrieved in [Step 1](#retrieve-project-dataset-ids).
      5. In the **Service Account JSON** field, paste the JSON project key you obtained in [Step 2.3](#create-gcp-iam-service-account).

#     Replication Details    #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:  
  - content: |
      For each day of export in {{ integration.display_name }}, {{ integration.display_name }} creates a table with the format `ga_sessions_YYYYMMDD`. The `YYYYMMDD` portion of the table's name corresponds to the date the data is for.

      Stitch uses the `YYYYMMDD` portion of the table's name to incrementally replicate data. When a new export with a `YYYYMMDD` value is greater than the previous export, Stitch will replicate the data for that day in full.

      {{ integration.display_name }} imports data into daily session tables several times throughout the day. For the current day, data isn't final until the daily import is complete. Refer to [Google's documentation](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/3437719?hl=en){:target="new"} for more info on this process.

      Because {{ integration.display_name }} performs data imports several times a day, you may notice differences between your data in {{ integration.display_name }} and the data replicated by Stitch. Allow a full day to see complete updates for the previous day's data.
