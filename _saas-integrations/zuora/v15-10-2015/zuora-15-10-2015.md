  - item: "**Administrator permissions in {{ integration.display_name }}.** These permissions are required to create a {{ integration.display_name }} user for Stitch."

setup-steps:
  - title: "Create a Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} user"
    anchor: "#create-stitch-zuora-user"
    content: |

      In this step, you'll create a {{ integration.display_name }} user for Stitch. Creating a Stitch-specific user will ensure that Stitch is distinguishable in any logs or audits.

      {% capture zuora-user-requirements %}
      To replicate your {{ integration.display_name }} data, Stitch requires a user that:

      1. **Has Standard user permissions.** While Stitch will only ever read your data, these permissions are required to access certain objects in {{ integration.display_name }}.
      2. **Has two-factor authentication disabled.** If this is enabled, connection and replication issues will occur after setup. Refer to the **Disable or Reset Two-Factor Authentication** section [in this {{ integration.display_name }} documentation](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Two-Factor_Authentication) for help disabling this setting.
      3. **Has credentials that don't expire.** This is applicable only if your company enforces Password Expiration rules. If Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} credentials expire, connection issues may arise. [Refer to this {{ integration.display_name }} support article for a workaround](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/kb/How_do_I_prevent_my_API_user_login_from_expiring%3F).
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include important.html first-line="**Zuora user requirements**" content=zuora-user-requirements %}

      #### Create the {{ integration.display_name }} user

      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/zuora-user-setup.png" alt="Zuora user permissions" max-width="400px" %}1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account, if you haven't already.
      2. Click your username in the top-right corner.
      3. Click **Administration**, then **Manage Users**.
      4. Click **Add Single User**.
      5. Enter a first and last name for the user.
      6. Enter an email address in the **Work Email** field.
      7. Enter an email address in the **Login Field**.
      8. In the **{{ integration.display_name }} Platform Role** field, select **Standard User**.
      9. For the remaining **Role** fields, select the **Standard User** option.
      10. There aren't any requirements for the **Locale** and **Language** fields - leave them as the defaults.
      11. Click **Save** to create the user.

      After the user is created, {{ integration.display_name }} will send a verification email to the email address in the **Work Email** field. Complete the verification and set a password for the Stitch user before moving on to the next step.

    content: |
      4. Enter the username and password of the Stitch user. Note that Stitch needs the username and password - entering a token and secret will result in an unsuccessful connection.
      5. If the instance you want to connect to Stitch is a sandbox, check the **Connect to a Sandbox Environment** box.

      To get a better understanding of how {{ integration.display_name }} objects relate to each other, check out [{{ integration.display_name }}'s Entity Relationship Diagram](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BB_Introducing_Z_Business/D_Zuora_Business_Objects_Relationship). 

      Understanding the relationships between different data sets will allow you to perform more in-depth and complex analyses.

      **Don't see a table listed here?** The list of tables shown below is not an exhaustive list of all the tables Stitch can replicate from {{ integration.display_name }}.

      We're working on adding documentation for additional {{ integration.display_name }} tables. If there's a specific table you'd like to see here, let us know by [opening an issue in the Stitch Docs GitHub repo](https://github.com/stitchdata/docs).
