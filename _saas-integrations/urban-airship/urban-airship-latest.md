# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **To verify your {{ integration.display_name }} API access.** {{ integration.display_name }} limits API access based on their product plans, meaning some plans have access while others do not.

      If you create an {{ integration.display_name }} integration and Stitch displays a `401 Unauthorized` or `403 Forbidden` error, you may not have access to {{ integration.display_name }}'s API.

requirements-info: "We recommend reaching out to {{ integration.display_name }} support to confirm your API access level before beginning the setup in Stitch."

setup-steps:

    content: |
      {% include note.html content="**Connect Multiple Urban Airship Apps**<br>If you want to connect multiple Urban Airship apps to Stitch, you will need to create a separate Urban Airship integration for each app. App credentials are app-specific, meaning only a single app can be connected per Stitch integration." %}

      1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. In the dashboard, open the app you want to connect to Stitch.
      3. If the Engage tab doesn't open, click **Engage** at the top to open it.
      4. Click the **gear icon** located near **Reports**, then select **APIs & Integrations**.
      5. The APIs & Integrations page will display.

      Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup.
