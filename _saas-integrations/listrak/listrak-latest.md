#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Create a {{ integration.display_name }} Stitch user"
    anchor: "create-stitch-listrak-user"
    content: |
      {% capture user-limit %}
      While we recommend doing creating a user for Stitch to ensure we're visible in any logs or audits, it may not be feasible as Listrak limits each account to five users.

      **Should you choose not to create a user for us**, you should verify that the user who creates the integration in Stitch has:

      1. Access to the Listrak lists you want to replicate, and
      2. The permissions listed in **Step 8** of this section.
      {% endcapture %}
      {% include note.html first-line="**Listrak user limits**" content=user-limit %}

      1. Sign into your Listrak account.
      2. From the home page, click **Manage**.
      3. Click **Accounts > User Manager**.
      4. Scroll to the bottom of the page and click **Create New User**.
      5. Fill in the **User Information** fields.
      6. In the **Lists** section, select the lists you want the Stitch user to have access to. **Note**: Stitch will only be able to replicate data for lists that it is able to access.
      7. For **Granted Access**, select **Role Based Access**.
      8. In the section below this field, select check the boxes for the following permissions:
         - **Analytics Access** - This allows the Stitch user to view analytics for messages, contacts, and lists for available lists.
         - **API Access** - This allows the Stitch user to replicate data from your {{ integration.display_name }} using the {{ integration.display_name }} API.
      9. Click **Add User** when finished.
  - title: "add integration"

      4. In the **Username** field, enter the Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} user's username.
