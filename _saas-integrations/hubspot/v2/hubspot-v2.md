## See this integration's folder in /_integration-schemas for details
## on the tables it contains.

schema-sections:
  - title: "Custom HubSpot field replication"
    anchor: "custom-field-replication"
    content: |
      Custom object properties, or fields, are supported by Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration. Stitch will query the `properties` list for each object and, if custom fields are available through {{ integration.display_name }}'s API, replicate them to your destination.

      The data types of these fields will be the same as the data type in HubSpot. For example: A custom field containing `date` data will be a `date` field in your destination.

      This is applicable to any object that supports custom fields in {{ integration.display_name }}.

  - title: "HubSpot date/date-time values & UNIX timestamps"
    anchor: "datetime-unix-timestamps"
    content: |
      [{{ integration.display_name }} uses UNIX-formatted timestamps in milliseconds](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/faq/how-should-timestamps-be-formatted-for-hubspots-apis){:target="new"} to store `date` and `datetime` data. Stitch doesn't perform any transformation during the replication process, meaning these values won't be converted to timestamps before they're loaded into your destination.

      To account for this, consider creating a user-defined function to perform the conversion or building views on top of the raw data.
