    anchor: "generate-recurly-api-key"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your Recurly account.
      2. From the Recurly dashboard, click the **Developers** option in the sidebar.
      3. Click **API credentials**.
      4. Click the **Add Private API Key** button.
      5. Enter a name for the key. We recommend something that will tell you, at a glance, who or what is using the key - for example, ‘Stitch.’
      6. The last section - **Will this key be used with a third-party application?** - is optional. 

         If you want to enter something here, you can select **Other** from the dropdown menu and then type Stitch into the **Application Name** field.
      7. When finished, click the **Save Changes** button to generate the key.

      Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.
  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. Enter the subdomain for your Recurly site. For example, if our subdomain were `stitch.recurly.com`, we would just enter `stitch` into this field.
      5. Paste the **Recurly API key** you generated into the **API Key** field.
