Connecting your Recurly data to Stitch is a four-step process:

1. [Generate a Recurly API Key](#generate-recurly-api-key)
2. [Add Recurly as a Stitch data source](#add-stitch-data-source)
3. [Define the Historical Sync](#define-historical-sync)
4. [Define the Replication Frequency](#define-rep-frequency)

### Generating a Recurly API Key {#generate-recurly-api-key}

**Note that to generate an API key, you'll need Admin permissions in your Recurly account.**

1. Sign into your Recurly account.
2. From the Recurly dashboard, click the **Developers** option in the sidebar.
3. Click **API credentials**.
4. Click the **Add Private API Key** button.
5. Enter a name for the key. We recommend something that will tell you, at a glance, who or what is using the key - for example, â€˜Stitch.â€™
6. The last section - **Will this key be used with a third-party application?** - is optional. 

   If you want to enter something here, you can select **Other** from the dropdown menu and then type Stitch into the **Application Name** field.
7. When finished, click the **Save Changes** button to generate the key.

Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.

{% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
4. Enter the subdomain for your Recurly site. For example, if our subdomain were `stitch.recurly.com`, we would just enter `stitch` into this field.
5. Paste the **Recurly API key** you generated into the **API Key** field.
