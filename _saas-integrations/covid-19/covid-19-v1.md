#      Feature Summary       #
# --------------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration was developed in a collaboration between [Bytecode](https://bytecode.io/){:target="new"} and [Talend](https://www.talend.com/){:target="new"}. It replicates data from multiple public data sources using the {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }}. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.

#      Setup Instructions    #
# ------------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **A regular (free) GitHub account.** The GitHub repo for this integration is public - no special access is required.


setup-steps:
  - title: "Create a GitHub personal access token"
    anchor: "create-access-token"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your GitHub account.
      2. Click the **User menu (your icon) > Settings**.
      3. Click **Developer settings** in the navigation on the left side of the page.
      4. Click **Personal access tokens**.
      5. On the Personal access tokens page, click the **Generate new token** button. If prompted, enter your password.
      7. In the **Description** field, enter `stitch`. This will allow you to easily identify what application is using the token.
      8. In the **Select Scopes** section, check the **repo** option:

         ![Highlighted repo scopes on the GitHub Personal Access Tokens page]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/github-token-scopes.png)

         **Note**: While these are full permissions, Stitch will only ever read your data. The **repo** scope is required due to how GitHub structures permissions.
      9. Click the **Generate token** button.
      10. The new access token will display on the next page. **Copy the token before navigating away from the page** - GitHub won't display it again.
