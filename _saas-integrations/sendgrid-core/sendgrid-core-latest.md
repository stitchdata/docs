  - item: |
      **Access to the objects you want to replicate from SendGrid.** This is required to grant the required permissions to the API key Stitch uses to connect to your SendGrid account.

      For example: If you want to replicate campaign data, you need to be able to access campaigns in your SendGrid account.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Create a SendGrid general API key for Stitch"
    anchor: "create-a-sendgrid-general-api-key"
    content: |
      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/sendgrid-core-api-key.png" alt="" max-width="300px" %}

      **Note:** You can't assign an API key greater permissions than you currently have in SendGrid.

      1. Sign into your SendGrid account.
      2. On the dashboard page, click **Settings > API Keys**.
      3. Click **Create API Key**.
      4. In the **API Key Name** field, enter a name for the key. For example: `Stitch API key`
      5. In the **API Key Permissions** section, select **Restricted Access**.
      6. In the **Access Details** section, enable the following:
         - **Email Activity** - Read Access
         - **Marketing Campaigns** - Full Access (**Note**: SendGrid doesn't currently provide a read-only level for this object.)
         - **Suppressions** - Read Access
         - **Template Engine** - Read Access
         - **Tracking** - Read Access
      7. Click **Create & View**.
      8. The API key will display. **Copy the key before closing the page**, as SendGrid won't display it again.
