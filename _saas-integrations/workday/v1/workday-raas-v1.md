#  Integration Replication   #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:

      Stitch uses Full Table Replication to replicate report data from {{ integration.display_name }}. This means that during every replication job, every report configured in the integration's settings will be replicated in full.

schema-sections:
  - content: |
      Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data from existing reports in your {{ integration.display_name }} account. For every report you configure while setting up the integration, Stitch will create a corresponding table in your destination.

      The fields available for selection are dependent on the data points that exist in the report in {{ integration.display_name }}. If you don't see a field you want to select in Stitch, verify that the report in {{ integration.display_name }} contains the field.
