#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.api | flatify | strip }}. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for details about the data Stitch will replicate.

  **Note**: A single {{ integration.display_name }} integration is limited to 10 Metrics and 7 Dimensions. This is due to limits enforced by Google. Refer to [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#metrics){:target="new"} for more info.

#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **At least Read & Analyze permissions in the account you want to connect to Stitch**. [See Google's documentation for more info](https://support.google.com/analytics/answer/2884495?hl=en){:target="new"}.

  - item: "**To have recent data in the account you want to connect to Stitch.** Verify that there is data from the past 30 days in the account before continuing."

  - item: "**To pause all ad-blocking software**. Because Google authentication uses pop ups, you may encounter issues if ad blockers aren't disabled during the setup."

      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Google account and to approve Stitch’s access to your {{ integration.display_name }} data. **Note that we will only ever read your data.**
      2. Click **Allow** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the {{ integration.display_name }} profile you want to connect to Stitch:

         ![Selecting a Google Analytics profile.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/ga-select-profiles.png)

         **Remember:** Profiles need to have Read & Analyze permissions to be detected by Stitch. If you don’t see the profile you want in this list, we recommend that you double-check the permission settings.
      4. When finished, click **Continue.**

      {% capture metrics-dims-considerations %}
      1. **Metric/Dimension combos that adhere to Google's compatibility rules can be saved.** Stitch will display a notification if a conflict is found while adding Metrics and Dimensions. Integrations with incompatible Metric/Dimension combos can't be saved.

         We recommend creating additional {{ integration.display_name }} integrations for different reports if you run into compatibility issues.

      2. **Metric/Dimension combos can't be changed after the integration is saved.** The Primary Key Stitch creates for {{ integration.display_name }} integration tables is a composite key composed of the Dimensions selected during setup. Adding or removing Dimensions will change the Primary Key, potentially leading to issues with identifying new data for replication or de-duping data.

      3. **Google limits the number of Metrics and Dimensions you can select.** You can select up to 10 Metrics and seven Dimensions per integration. Refer to [Google's documentation](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/v3/reference#metrics){:target="new"} for more info on these limits.

      4. **Segments and Filters aren't currently supported.** If you're interested in us adding these features, please get in touch with us.

      After you grant Stitch access to your {{ integration.display_name }} profile, you can select the specific Metrics and Dimensions you want to replicate to your destination.
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include note.html first-line="Before you get started, note the following:" content=metrics-dims-considerations %}

      1. In the Metrics and Dimensions fields, you can search or use the drop-down to explore your options:

         ![Selecting Metrics & Dimensions.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/integrations/ga-add-metrics.gif)

      2. Click the Metric or Dimension in the menu to add it to the configuration.
      3. **To add a Custom Metric or Dimension,** type out the name exactly in its entirety. If you try to search for it and add a Metric/Dimension that looks like this - `ga:customMetricXX` - you’ll run into issues.

         For example: let’s say you want to add `custom metric 10` to the configuration. To add it, you would type `ga:metric10` in the Choose Metrics field like this:

         ![Adding a custom metric.]({{site.baseurl}}/images/integrations/ga-add-custom-metric.gif)

         {% include tip.html content="**Not sure what the name of a custom Metric or Dimension is**? Sign into your Google Analytics Dashboard and open the Custom Metrics or Dimensions page (**Admin > Property Column > Custom Definitions > Custom Metric/Dimension**). <br><br>
         In the row for the Metric or Dimension, take the number in the **Index** column and append it to either `ga:metric` or `ga:dimension`. For example: if the index for a custom Dimension is `1`, the name would be `ga:dimension1`" %}

         4. As you add Metrics and Dimensions, Stitch will check for compatibility. If there are any conflicts, you'll need to resolve them before you can save the integration. Use [Google's Dimensions & Metrics Explorer](https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/reporting/core/dimsmets) as a guide when selecting Metrics and Dimensions.

         5. **Review your selections**. Remember: once saved, Metrics and Dimensions can't be added or removed.

         6. When you're finished, click {{ app.buttons.save-int-settings }}.
