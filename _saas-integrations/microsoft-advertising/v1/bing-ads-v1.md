# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **To pause all ad-blocking software currently in use.** Because {{ integration.display_name }} authentication uses pop ups, you may encounter issues if ad blockers aren't disabled during the setup.
  - item: |
      **To have Viewer permissions to the profiles you want to connect.** These read-only permissions will ensure Stitch can read data from the profiles you select for replication. [Read more about Bing Ads user permissions here](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52037/3/en-US/#ext:none){:target="new"}.

setup-steps:
  - title: "add integration"
  - title: "historical sync"
  - title: "replication frequency"
  - title: "Authorize Stitch and select {{ integration.display_name }} accounts"
    anchor: "auth-select-profiles"

      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/bing-ads-select-accounts.png" alt="Selecting Bing Ads accounts." max-width="400px" %}

      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Microsoft account and to approve Stitch’s access to your {{ integration.display_name }} data.
      2. Click **Authorize** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the {{ integration.display_name }} account(s) you want to connect to Stitch.

         If you don't see the account(s) you want to connect, verify that you have completed the [setup requirements](#setup-requirements).
      4. When selecting accounts, keep the following in mind:

         - **Only one top-level manager account can be selected.** If you need to connect multiple top-level accounts, we recommend creating additional {{ integration.display_name }} integrations.
         - **Selecting a subaccount will also select the parent**, or top-level account. If you de-select the parent account, you will be unable to select any subaccounts.
         - **If multiple subaccounts are selected, data for all the selected subaccounts will map to the same table in your destination.** For example: If two subaccounts are selected and the `accounts` table is tracked, account data for both accounts will be replicated into the `accounts` table. This is applicable to every table selected in the next step.

       5. When finished selecting accounts, click **Check and Save**.
