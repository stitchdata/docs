#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.api | flatify }}. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for a list of objects available for replication.


# -------------------------- #
#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **To pause all ad-blocking software currently in use.** Because {{ integration.display_name }} authentication uses pop ups, you may encounter issues if ad blockers aren't disabled during the setup.
  - item: |
      **To have Viewer permissions to the profiles you want to connect.** These read-only permissions will ensure Stitch can read data from the profiles you select for replication. [Read more about {{ integration.display_name }} user permissions here](https://help.bingads.microsoft.com/#apex/3/en/52037/3/en-US/#ext:none){:target="new"}.

setup-steps:
  - title: "add integration"
  - title: "historical sync"
    content: |
      {% capture retention-period-notice %}
      {{ integration.display_name }} retains reporting data for specified periods of time, which can impact the amount of historical data Stitch can replicate. Refer to the [Report retention periods and historical data](#retention-period-historical-data) section below for more info.
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include note.html first-line="**Note: Retention windows and historical data**" content=retention-period-notice %}

      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/bing-ads-select-accounts.png" alt="Selecting Bing Ads accounts." max-width="400px" %}

      1. Next, you’ll be prompted to log into your Microsoft account and to approve Stitch’s access to your {{ integration.display_name }}/Bing Ads data.
      2. Click **Authorize** to continue.
      3. After your credentials are validated, you’ll be prompted to select the {{ integration.display_name }}/Bing Ads account(s) you want to connect to Stitch.

         If you don't see the account(s) you want to connect, verify that you have completed the [setup requirements](#setup-requirements).
      4. When selecting accounts, keep the following in mind:

         - **Only one top-level manager account can be selected.** If you need to connect multiple top-level accounts, we recommend creating additional {{ integration.display_name }} integrations.
         - **Selecting a subaccount will also select the parent**, or top-level account. If you de-select the parent account, you will be unable to select any subaccounts.
         - **If multiple subaccounts are selected, data for all the selected subaccounts will map to the same table in your destination.** For example: If two subaccounts are selected and the `accounts` table is tracked, account data for both accounts will be replicated into the `accounts` table. This is applicable to every table selected in the next step.

       5. When finished selecting accounts, click **Check and Save**.

#      Replication Info      #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - title: "Report retention periods and historical data"
    anchor: "retention-period-historical-data"
    content: |
      {{ integration.display_name }} retains reporting data for specified periods of time. Depending on the type of report, the retention period can vary. For the majority of reports, however, {{ integration.display_name }} will retain data for **36 months** from the current date.

      This retention period can impact the historical data Stitch can replicate from {{ integration.display_name }}. If you select a **Start Date** further in the past than the retention period allows, a message similar to the following will surface in the integration's [Extraction Logs]({{ link.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl }}) during the extraction phase:

      ```
      tap - Message = "Bing reported that the requested report date range ended outside of their data retention period. Skipping to next range..."
      ```

      When this occurs, Stitch will move the **Start Date** up a month until extraction succeeds. For example: If `01/09/2015` is found to be outside of the retention period, Stitch will move the date range up to `01/10/2015`, then `01/11/2015`, and so on until extraction is successful. This will all occur in the same extraction job.

      Refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingads/guides/report-data-retention-time-periods?view=bingads-12){:target="_blank"} for more info about retention periods.
