#       Feature Summary      #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration relies on {{ integration.display_name }}'s [Data Delivery Service (DDS)](https://developer.intacct.com/data-delivery-service/){:target="new"} for Amazon S3. {{ integration.display_name }} DDS exports reports in CSV format to Amazon S3, which Stitch will then replicate using [Key-based Incremental Replication](#replication).

  While DDS supports other export targets, Stitch only supports replicating {{ integration.display_name }} data through Amazon S3 at this time.

  For more info about DDS, [refer to {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/help/More/Data_Delivery_Service/dds-overview.htm){:target="new"}.

  **Note**: This integration does not use the {{ integration.display_name }} API. Only data available via DDS will be available for replication through Stitch.


# -------------------------- #
#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **An active subscription to {{ integration.display_name }}'s [Data Delivery Service (DDS)](https://developer.intacct.com/data-delivery-service/){:target="new"}**. Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration currently only replicates data from Amazon S3 buckets used by this {{ integration.display_name }} feature.
  - item: "**An existing Amazon S3 bucket where {{ integration.display_name }} publishes data via DDS.** Stitch will not create a bucket for you."
  - item: |
      **Permissions in AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) that allow you to create policies, create roles, and attach policies to roles**. This is required to grant Stitch authorization to your S3 bucket.

  - title: "Set up an {{ integration.display_name }} Cloud Storage Target and automatic data delivery"
    anchor: "set-up-target-and-delivery"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll set up a Cloud Storage Target and automatic data delivery in {{ integration.display_name }}.

          {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: Skip this step if Inacct can already access your Amazon S3 bucket." %}

          1. Sign into your Amazon Web Services account.
          2. Navigate to the Amazon S3 bucket you want to use as the Cloud Storage Target for {{ integration.display_name }}.
          3. Follow the instructions in [Step 1 of {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/help/Reporting/Distribute_and_run_reports/Store_reports/cloud-storage-for-reports.htm?cshid=Reporting/Distribute_and_run_reports/Store_reports/cloud-storage-for-reports.htm#1.2){:target="new"} to enable {{ integration.display_name }} to access the bucket.

          1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
          2. Follow the instructions in [Step 2 of {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/help/Reporting/Distribute_and_run_reports/Store_reports/cloud-storage-for-reports.htm?cshid=Reporting/Distribute_and_run_reports/Store_reports/cloud-storage-for-reports.htm#1.){:target="new"} to create the target in {{ integration.display_name }}.

        anchor: "set-up-automated-data-delivery"

          In this step, you'll create an [automatic delivery schedule](https://www.intacct.com/ia/docs/help/More/Data_Delivery_Service/create-an-automated-delivery.htm#Config){:target="new"} in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

          1. In your {{ integration.display_name }} account, navigate to **Company > Data Delivery Service > Automatic**.
          2. Click the **Add** button.
          3. In the **File attributes** section, define the settings as follows:
             - **Delimiter**: Commas
             - **Text qualifier (delimiter)**: Double quote (`"`)
             - **Encryption**: Do not encrypt
          4. In the **Delivery options** section, define the settings as follows:
             - **Cloud storage destination**: Select the Amazon S3 Cloud Storage Target you created in [Step 1.2](#define-target-in-intacct).
             - **Frequency**: Select the frequency you want to use to trigger a data export in {{ integration.display_name }}.
          5. In the **Objects** section, select the objects you want to include in the export. These objects will then be available for selection in Stitch.
          6. Save the schedule.

      4. In the **Company ID** field, enter the company ID you use to sign into {{ integration.display_name }}.
      5. In the **S3 Bucket** field, enter the name of the bucket where the {{ integration.display_name }} Data Delivery Service (DDS) outputs data. Enter only the bucket name: No URLs, `https`, or S3 parts. For example: `intacct-stitch-bucket`
      6. In the **AWS Account ID** field, paste the AWS Account ID you retrieved in [Step 2](#retrieve-aws-account-id).
      7. **Optional**: In the **Path** field, enter the path configured in {{ integration.display_name }} for use in the S3 bucket.

#     Replication Details    #
# -------------------------- #

replication-sections:
  - content: |
      Stitch uses Key-based Incremental Replication to replicate data from {{ integration.display_name }} integrations. To identify new and updated data for replication, Stitch will use file modification timestamps as [Replication Keys]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and store them on a per-table basis. This means that only files dumped from a new {{ integration.display_name }} data sync will be selected for replication.
