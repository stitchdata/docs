{% assign integration = page %}
{% include misc/data-files.html %}

{% contentfor setup %}
Connecting your Pardot data to Stitch is a three-step process:

1. [Retrieve your Pardot API User Key](#retrieve-pardot-api-user-key)
2. [Whitelist Stitch's IP Addresses](#whitelist-stitch-ips)`*`
2. [Add Pardot as a Stitch data source](#add-stitch-data-source)
3. [Define the Replication Frequency](#define-rep-frequency)

`*` This step is necessary only if IP-based security is enabled for your Pardot account.

### Retrieve Your Pardot API User Key {#retrieve-pardot-api-user-key}

1. Sign into your Pardot account.
2. Hover over the **User** menu - it's where your email address is displayed, in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
3. In the dropdown menu that displays, click the **Settings** option. Your user information will display.
4. Locate the **API User Key** field.

Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.

### Whitelist Stitch's IP Addresses {#whitelist-stitch-ips}

{% include note.html type="single-line" content="If your Pardot account doesn't have IP-based security enabled, skip this step." %}

If your Pardot account allows access from certain IP addresses, you'll need to whitelist the Stitch's IP addresses for the connection to be successful.

**Note**: Admin permissions in Pardot are required to add and manage whitelisted IP addresses. [Refer to Pardot's documentation for more info](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_admin_ip_manage_whitelisted.htm&type=5).

Whitelist all of the following IP addresses in Pardot:

{% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
- {{ ip-address.ip }}
{% endfor %}

{% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
4. In the **Pardot User Key** field, paste your API User Key.

{% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}

{% include integrations/shared-setup/initial-syncs.html %}
{% endcontentfor %}
