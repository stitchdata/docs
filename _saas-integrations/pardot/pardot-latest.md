#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Whitelist Stitch's IP addresses"
    anchor: "whitelist-stitch-ips"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="This step is necessary only if IP-based security is enabled for your Pardot account. If your Pardot account doesn't have IP-based security enabled, [skip to the next step](#retrieve-pardot-api-user-key)." %}

      If your {{ integration.display_name }} account allows access from certain IP addresses, you'll need to whitelist the Stitch's IP addresses for the connection to be successful.

      **Note**: Admin permissions in {{ integration.display_name }} are required to add and manage whitelisted IP addresses. [Refer to {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation for more info](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=pardot_admin_ip_manage_whitelisted.htm&type=5){:target="new"}.

      Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account and whitelist all of the following IP addresses:

      {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
      - {{ ip-address.ip }}
      {% endfor %}

  - title: "Retrieve your {{ integration.display_name }} API user key"
    anchor: "retrieve-pardot-api-user-key"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account, if you aren't already.
      2. Hover over the **User** menu - it's where your email address is displayed, in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
      3. In the dropdown menu that displays, click the **Settings** option. Your user information will display.
      4. Locate the **API User Key** field.

      Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.
  
  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. In the **{{ integration.display_name }} User Key** field, paste your API User Key.
