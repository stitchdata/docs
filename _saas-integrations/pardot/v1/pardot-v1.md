requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **A user with a preferred timezone of UTC.** This is required to ensure you don't encounter Extraction errors during Daylight Savings Time, as some Replication Key fields used by Stitch are reported in {{ integration.display_name }} using the user's preferred timezone. By using UTC, this ensures that time data is accurately reported during extraction. Otherwise, you might encounter [Extraction errors during Daylight Savings Time]({{ link.troubleshooting.pardot-extraction-errors | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#out-of-order-data" }}).
