# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration relies on the {{ integration.display_name }} [Query product add-on](#setup-requirements), which utilizes a Snowflake database to store data.

  {{ integration.display_name }} integrations can replicate event and merged user ID data. Refer to the [Schema](#schema) section for more info.

# -------------------------- #
#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **To be on an {{ integration.display_name }} Enterprise or Growth plan**. Amplitude requires this to access the Query product add-on.  
  - item: |
      **To have purchased the {{ integration.display_name }} Query product add-on.** [Query](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115001902492-Query-Snowflake){:target="new"} is an {{ integration.display_name }}-managed Snowflake database, which Stitch's integration replicates data from.

      Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration connects to your {{ integration.display_name }}-managed Snowflake database to replicate data.

      To connect Stitch to {{ integration.display_name }}, you'll need to retrieve your Snowflake credentials from {{ integration.display_name }}. Reach out to [{{ integration.display_name }} support](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new){:target="new"} or your {{ integration.display_name }} Success Manager to get your credentials.

      When you receive your credentials, you can move onto the next step.

#     Integration Tables     #
# -------------------------- #

# Looking for the table schemas & info?
# Each table has a its own .md file in /_integration-schemas/amplitude

schema-sections:
  - content: |
      Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} replicates two types of tables: Events and merged user IDs.

      For each project in your {{ integration.display_name }} account, a set of these tables will be available for replication. Stitch will append a project's ID to each table name to make them easily identifiable. For example: If a project has an ID of `168342`, the events table for the project will be named `events_168432`.

      You can identify which tables are for a specific project by comparing the ID in the table name to the projects in your {{ integration.display_name }} account. You can access this page in your {{ integration.display_name }} account by clicking the **User menu (top right corner) > Settings > Projects**.
