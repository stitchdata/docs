{% contentfor setup %}
Connecting your Square data to Stitch a four-step process:

1. [Add Square as a Stitch data source](#add-stitch-data-source)
3. [Define the Historical Sync](#define-historical-sync)
4. [Define the Replication Frequency](#define-rep-frequency)
5. [Authorize Stitch to access Square](#authorize-stitch)

{% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}

{% include integrations/saas/setup/historical-sync.html %}

{% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}

### Authorizing Stitch to Access Square {#authorize-stitch}

Lastly, you'll be directed to Square's website to complete the setup.

1. Enter your Square credentials and click **Login**.
2. After the authorization process successfully completes, you'll be redirected back to Stitch.
3. Click {{ app.buttons.finish-int-setup }}.
