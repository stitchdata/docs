  - item: |
      **Access to any projects you want to replicate data from.** Stitch will only be able to access the same projects as the user who creates the integration.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Create a {{ integration.display_name }} token"
    anchor: "create-access-token"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your GitLab account.
      2. Click the **user menu (your icon) > Settings**.
      3. Click the **Access Tokens** tab.
      4. In the **Name** field, enter `Stitch`. This will allow you to easily identify what application is using the token.
      5. In the **Scopes** section, check the **api** box. This will allow Stitch to access your API and replicate your GitLab data.
      6. Click **Create Personal Access Token**.
      7. The new Access Token will display at the top of the page. **Copy the token before navigating away from the page** - GitLab won't display it again.
  - title: "Add {{ integration.display_name }} as a Stitch data source"
    anchor: "add-stitch-data-source"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
      4. In the **API URL** field, enter `https://gitlab.com/api/v4`.
      5. In the **Private Token** field, paste the **Personal Access Token** you created in the previous section.
      6. In the **Projects** and **Groups to Track** fields, you'll enter the projects and/or groups you want to track as a **space-separated** list.

         For example: `stitchdata/group-a`, or `stitchdata/project-a stitchdata/project-b`

         **Note**: A value for one of these fields must be provided. Additionally, the way you define these settings determines how some data is replicated:

         - If **groups** are provided but **projects** aren't, all group projects will be replicated.
         - If **groups** and **projects** are provided, the selected projects of the listed groups will be replicated.
         - If **projects** are provided but **groups** aren't, all listed projects will be replicated.
