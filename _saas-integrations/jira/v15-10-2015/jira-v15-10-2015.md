setup-steps:
  - title: "Whitelist Stitch's IP addresses"
    anchor: "whitelist-stitch-ips"
    content: |
      {% include note.html content="This step is only required if your JIRA instance is both self-hosted and behind a firewall." %}
      
      Whitelist all of the following IP addresses:

      {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
      - {{ ip-address.ip }}
      {% endfor %}

      Be sure to do this before continuing through the rest of the setup or you may encounter errors when saving the integration.

  - title: "Verify your protocol support"
    anchor: "verify-protocol-support"
    content: |
      {% include note.html content="This step is only required if your JIRA instance is self-hosted." %}

      If your JIRA instance is self-hosted, you'll also need to verify that your server uses `HTTPs` as the protocol. Stitch does not support `HTTP` for security reasons.

      When you complete the JIRA setup in Stitch, you'll be asked to enter your JIRA base URL. If Stitch determines that the protocol is not `HTTPs`, connection errors will arise.

  - title: "Retrieve your Stitch public key"
    anchor: "retrieve-stitch-public-key"
    content: |
      {{ site.data.tooltips.public-key | flatify }} In this case, when you add the public key to your JIRA instance, it allows Stitch to access and extract data from the account.

      1. {{ app.menu-paths.add-integration | flatify }}
      2. Click the **JIRA** icon.
      3. Locate the **Public Key** field.

      Leave this page open for now - you'll need this to set up the application access in JIRA in the next step.

  - title: "Grant Stitch application access to {{ integration.display_name }}"

      **Note that you need Administrator permissions to complete the steps in this section**. If you're not an Admin, loop in someone who can help you before continuing.

      1. Sign into your JIRA account.
      2. Click the **Settings (gear)** icon in the top-right corner.
      3. In the drop-down menu, click **Applications**.
      4. Click the **Application** link in the **Integrations** section of the menu on the left side of the page.
      5. In the **Application** field, enter `stitchdata.com`.
      6. Click **Create new link**.

      A few ‘Configure Application URL’ messages might display after clicking the **Create new link** button. If you see these, don’t worry - everything is still on track.

      Click **Continue** to keep going.
    substeps:
      - title: "Define the first set of link application settings"
        anchor: "define-first-link-application-settings"
        content: |
          1. When the **Link Applications** window displays, enter `stitch` into the following fields:
             - Application Name
             - Service Provider Name
          2. Set the **Application Type** field to **Generic Application**.
          3. Enter `rjmetrics` into the following fields:
             - Consumer Key
             - Shared Secret
          4. Enter `stitchdata.com` into the following fields:
             - Request Token URL
             - Token URL
             - Authorize URL
          5. Check the **Create incoming link** box.
          6. Click the **Continue** button and a second Link Applications window will display.

      - title: "Define the second set of link application settings"
        anchor: "define-second-link-application-settings"
        content: |
          1. In the **Consumer Key** field, enter `rjmetrics`.
          2. In the **Consumer Name** field, enter `stitch`.
          3. In the **Public Key** field, paste the entire Public Key from the Stitch JIRA credentials page.
          4. Click the **Continue** button.

          If the link configuration was successful, you’ll see a **Success!** message on the Configure Application Links page.

  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. In the **Base URL** field, enter the base URL for your JIRA site. **Remember**: If you're connecting a self-hosted instance, your server must use the `HTTPs` protocol or Stitch will be unable to successfully connect.

## Issues

    notes: |
      ### Accounting for Deleted Issues
      When an issue is hard-deleted in JIRA, the record for the issue will remain in your data warehouse. This happens because of the Replication Method the `jira_issues` table uses and how JIRA's API functions.
      
      - The `jira_issues` table is incrementally replicated based on the `updated_at` column. This means that rows with values in this column that are greater than or equal to the last recorded MAX value will be selected for replication. If a record is hard-deleted, there won't be a value to check and thus no way to detect changes to the record.
      - JIRA's API doesn't include a flag to indicate deletes.
      
      [The suggested workaround](https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/75537/how-do-i-find-if-an-issue-has-been-deleted) (although it may be a bit cumbersome) is to use the `fields__status__name` column - which indicates the current status of an issue - to track deletes. Before deleting the issue, you could change the status to something that would only indicate a delete and then use that status as a filter in your queries.
