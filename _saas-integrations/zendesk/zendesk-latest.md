      **Administrator permissions in Zendesk**. Some data types in Zendesk may only be accessed with Admin permissions. For example: To replicate ticket metric or tag data, Zendesk's API requires a user with Admin permissions.

      To ensure you can replicate all the data you need, we recommend a user with Admin permissions set up the integration.
     
  - To replicate the **ticket_forms** table, an Enterprise Zendesk plan or Professional Zendesk plan with the corresponding add-on.
  
      [This feature](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203661636-Managing-your-ticket-forms-) is only availble to Zendesk customers on the listed plans.
