#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Administrator permissions in {{ integration.display_name }}**. Only users with the [{{ integration.display_name }} Administrator role can create an API token](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/226022787-Generating-a-new-API-token-){:target="_blank"}, which is required to complete the setup.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Create a Zendesk API token"
    anchor: "create-zendesk-api-token"
    content: |
      1. Sign into your Zendesk account.
      2. Click the **Settings** (gear) icon in the left sidebar.
      3. When the Settings menu displays, locate the **Channels** section. 
      4. Click the **API link** in this section.
      5. Verify that the **Token Access** setting is enabled.
      6. Click the **+** button in the **Active API Tokens** section to create a new token.
      8. When prompted, enter a description for the token. We recommend using 'Stitch,' so you will know, at a glance, what application is using the token.
      9. Copy the token into a text file. **Do NOT click Save until you've copied the token**, as Zendesk only displays API tokens once for security reasons. If you save before copying the token, you'll have to create another one.
      10. After you've copied the token, click **Save.**
  - title: "add integration"
    content: |
      4. In the **Site Prefix** field, enter your Zendesk site prefix. For example: For `stitchdata.zendesk.com`, only `stitchdata` would be entered into this field.
      5. In the **Login Email** field, enter the email of the user who created the Zendesk API token in step one.
      6. In the **API Token** field, enter the user's password.

tables:
## Audits
  - name: "audits"
    doc-link: https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/ticket_audits
    description: "info about the activity associated with a ticket. This table contains the history of a ticket, with each audit event representing a single update to the ticket."
    notes: |
      ### Event Types
      For event types, see [Zendesk's documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/ticket_audits#audit-events).
    replication-method: "Key-based Incremental"
    primary-key: "id"

      ### Group Membership Record Deletes
      As Zendesk's API doesn't currently provide a method for identifying deleted records, we recommend periodically dropping this table and allowing Stitch to re-create it. Currently, dropping and re-populating the table is the only way to detect deletions.

      ### Archived Ticket Metrics
      As Zendesk's API doesn't currently support returning metrics for archived tickets, **this table will not contain any metrics for archived tickets.**

      If you believe you're missing records, check in your Zendesk account to see if the missing records are for archived tickets.
      
      For more info on how Zendesk handles archiving tickets, [check out their documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203657756).
