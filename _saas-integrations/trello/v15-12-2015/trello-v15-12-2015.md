#      Setup Instructions    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **To be a member of every {{ integration.display_name }} board you want to replicate.** If a board is private and the user isn't a member, Stitch will be unable to access it. Before beginning the setup process, verify that the user setting up the integration has access to all the boards you want to replicate.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Retrieve your developer API keys from {{ integration.display_name }}"
    anchor: "retrieve-trello-api-keys"
    content: |
      ![]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/trello-developer-keys.png){:align="right" style="max-width: 250px"}

      1. Sign into your {{ integration.display_name }} account.
      2. Go to the [{{ integration.display_name }} Developer API Keys page](https://trello.com/app-key/){:target="new"}.
      3. Add `https://app.stitchdata.com` to the **Allowed Origins**.
      4. Locate the following fields:
         - The **Key** field in the **Developer API Keys** section
         - The **Secret** field in the **OAuth** section

      Leave this page open for now - you'll need it to complete the setup in Stitch.
  - title: "Add {{ integration.display_name }} as a Stitch data source"
    anchor: "add-stitch-data-source"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
      4. In the **{{ integration.display_name }} Account Key** field, paste the value from the **Key** field on the Developer API Keys page.
      5. In the **{{ integration.display_name }} Account Secret** field, paste the value from the **Secret** field on the Developer API Keys page.
  - title: "Define the historical replication start date"
    anchor: "define-historical-sync"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/saas/setup/historical-sync.html %}
  
  - title: "Create a replication schedule"
    anchor: "define-rep-frequency"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}

  - title: "Authorize Stitch to access {{ integration.display_name }}"
    anchor: "grant-stitch-authorization"
    content: |
      1. Next, you'll be redirected to {{ integration.display_name }} to grant Stitch access to your {{ integration.display_name }} data.
      2. Click **Allow** to grant authorization to Stitch.
      3. After the authorization process is successfully completed, you'll be directed back to Stitch.
      4. Click {{ app.buttons.finish-int-setup }}.
