    #### Deleted group memberships


    As {{ integration.display_name }}''s API doesn''t currently provide a method for
    identifying deleted group memberships, we recommend periodically dropping this
    table and allowing Stitch to re-create it. Currently, dropping and re-populating
    the table is the only way to detect deletions.
