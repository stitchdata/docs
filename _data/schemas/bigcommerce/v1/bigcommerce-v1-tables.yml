    This table uses Full Table Replication, which means all records will be replicated
    during every replication job.


    To avoid re-replicating unnecessary data, create a second {{ integration.display_name
    }} integration in your Stitch account (you can even use the same {{ integration.display_name
    }} API credentials) and set the integration to replicate every 12 or 24 hours.
