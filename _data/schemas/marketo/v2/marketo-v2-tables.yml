  description: 'In [version 1 of Stitch''s Marketo integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/{{
    integration.name }}/v1), the `activities` table contained all data pertaining
    to lead activities.


    In this version, you can choose to replicate lead activity data for specific activity
    types. For every activity type defined in your {{ integration.display_name }}
    account, you''ll see an `{{ table.name }}` table in the {{ app.buttons.tables
    }} tab. For example: `activities_click_email` contains lead activity data for
    the `click_email` activity type.


    These tables will contain the fields listed below, along with any fields specific
    to that activity type.

    Stitch replicates leads from {{ integration.display_name }} using the Bulk API.
    The Replication Key for this table varies depending on your {{ integration.display_name
    }} account setup:


    - **If updatedAt filtering is enabled**, this table will use `updatedAt` as the
    Replication Key

    - **If updatedAt filtering isn''t enabled,** this table will use `createdAt` as
    the Replication Key. Additionally, data will be loaded using [Append-Only loading]({{
    link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
