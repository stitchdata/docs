    #### Replication requirements {#replication-requirements-changelogs}


    To replicate this data:


    1. The [`issues`](#issues) table must also be set to replicate. **Note**: When
    an issue is updated, all the changelogs for that issue will also be replicated.


    2. The `Browse Projects` [project {{ integration.display_name }} permission]({{
    integration.project-permissions-doc }}){:target="new"} is required. Refer to [{{
    integration.display_name }}''s API documentation]({{ table.doc-link }}){:target="new"}
    for more info.

  description: "The `issues` table contains info about the issues in your {{ integration.display_name\
    \ }} instance. This table only contains core issue data - some data is located\
    \ in other tables, such as [`changelogs`](#changelogs), [`issue_comments`](#issue_comments),\
    \ and [`issue_transitions`](#issue_transitions).\n\n**Note**: To replicate this\
    \ data, the `Browse projects` [project {{ integration.display_name }} permission]({{\
    \ integration.project-permissions-doc }}){:target=\"new\"} for the project that\
    \ the issue is in is required. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s API\

    \ Identifying deleted issues\n\nWhen an issue is hard-deleted in JIRA, the record\
    \ for the issue will remain in your destination. This is due to the nature of\
    \ Stitch [Replication Keys]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: baseurl }})\
    \ and the design of JIRA's API:\n\n- **Replication Keys**: This table uses the\
    \ values in the `{{ replication-keys | strip }}` column to identify new and updated\
    \ data for replication. If a record is hard-deleted, there won't be a value for\
    \ Stitch to check and thus no way to identify the change, meaning the record will\
    \ remain in the destination.\n- **JIRA's API**: Currently, JIRA's API doesn't\
    \ include a way to identify deleted issues.\n\nTo identify deleted issues, [Atlassian's\
    \ suggested workaround](https://answers.atlassian.com/questions/75537/how-do-i-find-if-an-issue-has-been-deleted){:target=\"\
    new\"} is:\n\n1. Create a status in JIRA that will be applied to issues you want\
    \ to delete.\n2. **Before deleting the issue, apply the status**.\n3. Allow Stitch\
    \ to extract and load the updated data into your destination.\n4. Delete the issue.\n\
    5. After Stitch finishes loading the data, use the `fields__status__name` field\
    \ in your queries to filter issues with the deleted status you applied in step\
    \ 2. For example, the following query would return any issues that had been marked\
    \ with a the deleted status:\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT *\n   FROM stitch_jira.issues\n\
    \   WHERE fields__status__name = 'Deleted'\n   ```\n"
