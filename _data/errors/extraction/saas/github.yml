## MALFORMED SHEET  
  - message: *dependent-table
    id: "dependent-table"
    applicable-to: &github "GitHub integrations"
    level: "TODO"
    category: "Data selection"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Dependent table"
    cause: |
      A table is selected for replication that relies on another table also being selected.

      This means that to extract data for the dependent table, data for the 'parent' table must also be extracted.

      For example: To replicate `pull_request_reviews`, the `pull_requests` table must be selected. In this case, for every pull request Stitch replicates, the reviews for that pull request will also be replicated.
    fix-it: |
      Verify that the the parent table listed in the error is set to replicate.
