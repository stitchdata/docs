## No Bulk API permissions
  - message: *no-bulk-permissions
    id: "no-bulk-permissions"
    applicable-to: "Salesforce v1 integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "User/organization permissions"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Insufficient Bulk API permissions"
    cause: |
      This error can have different causes:
      - The Salesforce organization associated with the integration doesn't have access to the Bulk API.
      - The user does not have the **View Setup and Configuration** permission.
    fix-it: |
      Contact a Salesforce administrator or Salesforce support to inquire about obtaining the required permissions. Once access is granted, you'll be able to use the Bulk API.

      Otherwise, create a new Salesforce integration in Stitch and select **REST** for the integration's Extraction API.

## Bulk API total quota limit
  - message: *total-api-quota-limit
    id: "bulk-total-api-quota-limit"
    api-type: "Bulk API"
    applicable-to: "Salesforce v1 integrations"
    level: "critical"
    <<: *api-quota
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Total Bulk API quota reached"
    cause: &total-api-quota-cause |
      Stitch reached the limit for the total API quota the integration is configured to use. This is controlled by the integration's **Max Percentage of total standard API quota** setting.
    fix-it: &api-quota-fix |
      Review your overall Salesforce API usage and adjust either the integration's settings or your usage in other applications.

      **Note**: While encountering this error will end the Extraction job, Stitch will resume replication when additional quota becomes available.

## REST API total quota limit

    level: "critical"
    <<: *api-quota

    cause: &job-api-quota-cause |
      The current replication job used the total amount of API quota the integration is configured to use. This is controlled by the integration's **Max Percentage of standard API quota per job** setting.
    fix-it: *api-quota-fix

## Unsupported Bulk API fields

## Operation too large
  - message: *operation-too-large
    id: "operation-too-large"
    applicable-to: "Salesforce v1 integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Salesforce user permissions"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Request result set is too large for Salesforce"
    cause: |
      The user who authorized the integration in Stitch doesn't have the **View All Data** permission, which is required to successfully query a large number of Activity records.

      From [Salesforce's documentation](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000334313&type=1&mode=1){:target="new"}:

      > When a user without the **View All Data** permission tries to run a report on Activities which queries a large number of related records, the user may receive an error message saying `Operation too Large` or `Exceeded 100000 distinct who/what's in a Report`.
    fix-it: |
      The user who authorized the integration in Stitch should reach out to a Salesforce System Administrator and request the **View All Data** permission. This should allow replication to complete successfully.
