  - message: *subsidiary-not-allowed
    id: "subsidiary-not-allowed"
    applicable-to: &netsuite-v1 "NetSuite v1 integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "User permissions"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Subsidiary-level permissions are unsupported"
    cause: |
      Subsidiary-specific permissions aren't compatible with Stitch's NetSuite integration. The permissions granted to the NetSuite user authorizing the integration must be account-level permissions.
    fix-it: |
      Grant the authorizing NetSuite user account-level permissions.

  - message: *insufficient-record-permissions
    id: "insufficient-record-permissions-record-type"
    applicable-to: *netsuite-v1
    level: "critical"
    category: "User permissions"
    version: "1"
    summary: "Insufficient NetSuite user permissions for record type"
    cause: |
      This error can have two caues:

      1. The NetSuite user authorizing the integration doesn't have the permissions required to access this record type, OR
      2. The table in the error is related to a specific feature in NetSuite that your NetSuite account doesn't have access to. For example: Accounting Periods.
    fix-it: |
      To resolve this issue:

      1. Verify that your NetSuite account has access to the feature the table relates to. For example: Accounting Periods.

         If your account doesn't have access to the feature, de-select the table in Stitch to allow replication for other tables to proceed.

      2. If your account does have access to the feature, grant the authorizing NetSuite user the permissions required to access the record type related to the feature. For example: Accounting Periods.

         Refer to the [NetSuite setup guide]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/integrations/saas/netsuite-suitetalk/#create-configure-stitch-role" }}) for instructions and info about the permissions Stitch requires.

  - message: *concurrent-request-limit

    category: "NetSuite limitation"
    version: "1" 
    summary: "Concurrent API sessions not allowed"
    cause: |
      The NetSuite user authorizing the integration has multiple active API sessions.
    fix-it: |
      NetSuite allows a user to have one active API session at a time. If you have multiple NetSuite integrations - even if they're outside of Stitch - we recommend [creating a NetSuite user for each integration]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/integrations/saas/netsuite-suitetalk/#create-configure-stitch-role" }}) to ensure replication isn't delayed by this NetSuite limitation.

    summary: "Insufficient SOAP web services permissions"
    cause: |
      The NetSuite user authorizing the integration doesn't have the `Web Services` permission. This is required to allow Stitch to use the SuiteTalk API and extract data from NetSuite.
    fix-it: |
      Grant the authorizing NetSuite user the `Web Services` permission as outlined in the [NetSuite setup guide]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/integrations/saas/netsuite-suitetalk/#configure-permissions-save-stitch-role" }}).

    summary: "Insufficient transaction type permissions"
    cause: |
      The NetSuite user authorizing the integration doesn't have the permission required to access this transaction type.
    fix-it: |
      Grant the authorizing NetSuite user the permission required to access the transaction type. Refer to the **Object permissions** tab in the [NetSuite setup guide]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/integrations/saas/netsuite-suitetalk/#configure-permissions-save-stitch-role" }}) for a list of permissions.

    summary: "Web Services hasn't been enabled"
    cause: |
      The Web Services feature hasn't been enabled for your NetSuite account. This is required to allow Stitch to use the SuiteTalk API and extract data from NetSuite.
    fix-it: |
      Enable the Web Services feature and token-based authentication as outlined in the [NetSuite setup guide]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/integrations/saas/netsuite-suitetalk/#enable-web-services" }}).

    version: "1"
    summary: "Stitch's IP addresses aren't whitelisted"
    cause: |
      Your NetSuite account enforces IP address rules and Stitch's IP addresses haven't been whitelisted in your NetSuite account.
    fix-it: |
      Add Stitch's IP addresses to the **Allowed IP addresses** list for your NetSuite account as outlined in the [NetSuite setup guide]({{ site.baseurl | append: "/integrations/saas/netsuite-suitetalk/#whitelist-stitch-ips" }}).

    summary: "NetSuite account maintenance"
    cause: |
      NetSuite is performing maintenance on your account, making it temporarily unavilable.
    fix-it: |
      No action is needed on your part. Replication will resume based on the integration's schedule and succeed when NetSuite completes maintenance on your account.
