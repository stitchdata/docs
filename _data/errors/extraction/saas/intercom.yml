  - message: "Another integration is syncing Companies via the Scroll API. This will cause one to fail while the other succeeds"
    id: "companies-multiple-connections"

    summary: "Multiple connections syncing Companies"
    cause: |
      [Intercom's API limits the number of simultaneous requests](https://developers.intercom.com/intercom-api-reference/v2.0/reference#iterating-over-all-companies){:target="new"} a single Intercom app, or connection, can make to the Scroll over all companies endpoint. Stitch uses this endpoint to replicate the `companies` table. Currently, only one request can occur at a time.

      If multiple connections exist and they attempt to use this endpoint at the same time, only the connection who made the request first will succeed.

      This means that if Stitch attempts to extract data when another connection is using the endpoint, Extraction will fail and this error will surface in the Extraction Logs. 
    fix-it: |
      To prevent or minimize this issue, we recommend limiting the number of connections a single workspace has or scheduling extraction jobs in Stitch around your other connections' usage.
