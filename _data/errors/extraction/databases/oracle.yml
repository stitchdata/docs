## View replication error
  - message: *logminer-views
    id: "logminer-views-not-supported"
    applicable-to: &all-oracle "All Oracle-backed database integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: &log-based-category "Log-based Incremental Replication"
    category-doc: |
      {{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation--views-are-unsupported" }}
    version: "1"
    summary: "A database view is using Log-based Incremental Replication"
    cause: |
      The source object is a database view. Binary logging doesn't track events that occur in database views, so Stitch is unable to use Log-based Replication for views.
    
    fix-it: |
      Change the view's Replication Method to [Key-based Incremental]({{ link.replication.key-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) or [Full Table]({{ link.replication.full-table | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

  ## View replication error
  - message: *unsupported-version-for-logminer
    id: "unsupported-version-for-logminer"
    applicable-to: &all-oracle "All Oracle-backed database integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: &log-based-category "Log-based Incremental Replication"
    category-doc: |
      {{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation--views-are-unsupported" }}
    version: "1"
    summary: "The database is using a version that doesn't support LogMiner"
    cause: |
      The database is using a version that doesn't include support for Oracle's LogMiner package, which Stitch uses to perform Log-based Incremental Replication.

      {% assign oracle-database = site.database-integrations | where:"key","oracle-integration" | first %}
      {% assign logminer-versions = oracle-database.log-based-replication-minimum-version | append: " through " | append: oracle-database.log-based-replication-maximum-version %}

      The database must be using a version from {{ logminer-versions | flatify }}.
    
    fix-it: |
      To resolve this error, you have two options:

      1. Modify the database to use a version that supports LogMiner
      2. Use either [Full Table]({{ link.replication.full-table | prepend: site.baseurl }}) or [Key-based Incremental Replication]({{ link.replication.key-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) instead


## Unsupported supplemental_log_data parameter value
  - message: *supplemental-logging-not-all
    id: "supplemental-logging-incorrect"
    applicable-to: *all-oracle 
    level: "critical"
    category: *log-based-category
    category-doc: "{{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
    version: "1"
    summary: "Supplemental logging is incorrectly defined"
    cause: |
      Supplemental logging is incorrectly defined either for the database or the table. Supplemental logging is required by Oracle to use LogMiner, which Stitch uses to perform Log-based Incremental Replication.
    fix-it: |
      Stitch supports supplemental logging at the database and table level:

      - If enabled at the **database** level, tables do not need to be individually configured:

         ```sql
         {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.oracle.supplemental-logging.database-level | strip }}
         ```

      - If enabled at the **table** level, tables need to be individually configured. Run the following for every table you want to replicate through Stitch:

         ```sql
         {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.oracle.supplemental-logging.table-level | strip }}
         ```

      Refer to the [Oracle documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/oracle#enable-supplemental-logging) for more info.


## Log retention settings & purges
  - message: *missing-logfile
    id: "missing-logfile"
    applicable-to: *all-oracle 
    level: "critical"
    category: *log-based-category
    category-doc: |
      {{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation--log-retention" }}
    version: "1"
    summary: "Missing log files and insufficient RMAN retention policy settings"
    cause: |
      The requested log file has been removed from the server. When a log file is removed before Stitch can read from it, replicaiton will be unable to proceed.

      This error typically arises due to [insufficient RMAN retention policy settings]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/oracle#configure-rman-backups), which define how long log files remain on a server before they're automatically purged.

      It can also be caused by log files being purged before historical replication completes or critical errors that prevent Stitch from replicating data. When this occurs, it means Stitch was unable to proceed to the log file before the retention period passed and the log was purged.
    fix-it: |
      To resolve the error, you'll need to perform an integration-level reset. To do this, open the **{{ app.page-names.int-settings }}** page and click the {{ app.buttons.reset-rep-keys }} button. This will clear the integration's Replication Keys and queue a full re-replication of the integration.

      To prevent this error in the future, verify your RMAN retention policy settings and update them if needed. Stitch recommends a minimum of 3 days, but 7 days is preferred. This ensures that you have time to resolve any issues that arise before logs age out and are purged. Refer to the [Oracle documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/oracle#configure-rman-backups) for more info.

      In addition, make sure you resolve any connection or replication issues quickly. This will reduce the likelihood that log files will age out and cause this error.


# No new data during RMAN retention window
  - message: *no-logfile-current-session
    id: "no-logfile-current-session"
    applicable-to: *all-oracle 
    level: "critical"
    category: *log-based-category
    category-doc: |
      {{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}
    version: "1"
    summary: "Unavailable SCNs and RMAN retention window settings"
    cause: |
      LogMiner is unable to locate the System Change Number (SCN) value Stitch has saved. SCNs are used to identify data in log files for Log-based Incremental Replication.

      - **No new data is logged for the length of the RMAN retention window.** For example: If the RMAN retention window is set to 2 days and no new data is created for two consecutive days, this error may occur.
      
      - **The integration is paused for longer than the RMAN retention window.** For example: If the RMAN retention window is set to 2 days and the integration is paused in Stitch for longer than two days, this error may occur.
    fix-it: |
      1. Verify the current RMAN retention window length.
      2. [Increase the RMAN retention window]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/oracle#configure-rman-backups). For example: Increase the window from 2 days to 7.
      3. Perform an integration level reset. To do this, open the **{{ app.page-names.int-settings }}** page and click the {{ app.buttons.reset-integration }} button. This will clear the integration's Replication Keys and queue a full re-replication of the integration.

# ORA-01341: LogMiner out-of-memory
# Cause: The LogMiner session requires more system resources than is currently available.

# Action: Allocate more SGA for LogMiner.

# ORA-01343: LogMiner encountered corruption in the logstream
# Cause: Log file is missing a range of scn values.

# Action: Verify the contiguity of the scn range represented by the log files added to LogMiner.
