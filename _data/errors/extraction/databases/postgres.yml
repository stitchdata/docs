## This file contains the extraction errors that can arise 
## while replicating data from a PostgreSQL-backed database.

      Stitch is unable to find a replication slot that adheres to [Stitch's naming requirements]({{ postgres-v2.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}#create-replication-slot).

    fix-it: |
      Verify that a replication slot exists for the database you're trying to connect, and that it adheres to [Stitch's naming requirements]({{ postgres-v2.url | prepend: site.baseurl }}#create-replication-slot).

  - message: *ssl-required-error
    id: "ssl-required-error"
    applicable-to: "Google CloudSQL PostgreSQL v2 database integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "SSL configuration"
    version: "2"
    summary: "SSL connections can't be required"
    cause: |
      The Google CloudSQL PostgreSQL instance is configured to require SSL to connect. This configuration isn't currently supported, as it requires the database to expect client certifications.

    fix-it: |
      Verify that the instance isn't set to require SSL in Google Cloud. If it is, disable the setting and re-try the connection in Stitch.
