    summary: "Change tracking isn't enabled for a database"
    cause: |
      Change Tracking is not enabled for the named database, which contains tables that are set to replicate and use Log-based Incremental Replication in Stitch.
    fix-it: |
      Enabled Change Tracking for the database referenced in the error message. To use Change Tracking, you must enabled it both at the database and table level.

      To enable Change Tracking for the database, log into your database and run the following statement, replacing `<database_name>` with the name of the database:

      ```sql
      {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.mssql.enable-change-tracking-for-database | strip }}
      ```

    summary: "Change tracking isn't enabled for a table"
    cause: |
      Change tracking is not enabled for the named table, which is set to replicate and use Log-based Incremental Replication.
    fix-it: |
      Enable change tracking for the table referenced in the error message. To use Change Tracking, you must enabled it both at the database and table level. Microsoft SQL Server requires that Change Tracking be enabled for every table you want to use Log-based Incremental for.

      To enable Change Tracking for the table, log into your database and run the following statement, replacing `<schema_name>.<table_name>` with the names of the schema and table:

      ```sql
      {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.mssql.enable-change-tracking-for-table | strip }}
      ```

      Run the statement for every table you want to replicate using Log-based Incremental Replication.
