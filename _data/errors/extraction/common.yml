#  Common Extraction Errors  #
# -------------------------- #

## This file contains the extraction errors that are common
## across all integrations.

raw-error:
  10k-table-limit: &10k-table-limit |
    Stitch has discovered more than the maximum supported limit of 10,000 tables in your integration.

  time-limit: &time-limit-error "The process was terminated. Most often this occurs because the job has exceeded its allotted runtime. The next job will run based on the integration's schedule."

## The max record size value is kept in the Import API data files: _/data/import-api/general.yml
  record-size-limit: &record-size-limit-error "A single record is larger than the Stitch API limit of {{ site.data.import-api.general.max-record-size }}"

time-limit: &time-limit
  message: *time-limit-error
  id: "time-limit"
  applicable-to: "All integrations"
  level: "info"
  category: "Extraction job limits"
  summary: "Extraction job time limit exceeded"
  cause: |
    The extraction exceeded the maximum 24 hours limit set for individual extraction jobs.

    Stitch sets a maximum limit of 24 hours for individual extraction jobs. This is done to balance resource usage across Stitch, and to help prevent unexpected or unintended continuations of connections against integrations.
  fix-it: |
    To help decrease the runtime of extraction, we recommend de-selecting unneeded tables and columns. This will reduce the amount of data being replicated.

    Stitch will automatically retry extraction based on the integration's schedule.

record-size-limit: &record-size-limit
  message: "{{ site.data.errors.extraction.common.raw-error.record-size-limit | flatify }}"
  id: "record-size-limit"
  applicable-to: "All integrations"
  level: "critical"
  category: "Extraction job limits"
  summary: "Maximum record size exceeded"
  cause: |
    A single record exceeded the maximum size limit of {{ site.data.import-api.general.max-record-size }}. This limit is imposed by the [Import API]({{ link.getting-started.basic-concepts | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#system-architecture" }}), which Stitch uses as part of the replication process. 
  fix-it: |
    Locate the record in the source and, if possible, modify it to be less than Stitch's limit. You can also try de-selecting columns in the table containing the record.

databases:
  - <<: *time-limit
  - <<: *record-size-limit
  - message: *10k-table-limit
    id: "10k-table-limit"
    applicable-to: "All database integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Discovery job limits"
    summary: "Maximum discoverable table limit exceeded"
    cause: |
      Stitch discovered more than the maximum limit of 10,000 tables for the integration.
    fix-it: |
      Decrease the number of discoverable tables by limiting the Stitch database user's access only to tables you want to replicate. You can accomplish this by altering the Stitch database user's privileges in the database.

      Refer to the [documentation for your database]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/#all-database-integrations) for instructions.
