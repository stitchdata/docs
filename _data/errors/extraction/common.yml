#  Common Extraction Errors  #
# -------------------------- #

## This file contains the extraction errors that are common
## across all integrations.

raw-error:
  10k-table-limit: &10k-table-limit |
    Stitch has discovered more than the maximum supported limit of 10,000 tables in your integration.

  time-limit: &time-limit-error "The process was terminated.  Most often this occurs because the job has exceeded its allotted runtime. The next job will run based on the integration's schedule."


time-limit: &time-limit
  message: *time-limit-error
  id: "time-limit"
  applicable-to: "All integrations"
  level: "info"
  category: "Extraction job limits"
  summary: "Extraction job time limit exceeded"
  cause: |
    The extraction exceeded the maximum six hour limit set for individual extraction jobs.

    Stitch sets a maximum limit of six hours for individual extraction jobs. This is done to balance resource usage across Stitch, and to help prevent unexpected or unintended continuations of connections against integrations.
  fix-it: |
    To help decrease the runtime of extraction, we recommend de-selecting unneeded tables and columns. This will reduce the amount of data being replicated.

    Stitch will automatically retry extraction based on the integration's schedule.

  - <<: *time-limit
  - message: *10k-table-limit
    id: "10k-table-limit"
    applicable-to: "All integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Discovery job limits"
    summary: "Maximum discoverable table limit exceeded"
    cause: |
      Stitch discovered more than the maximum limit of 10,000 tables for the integration.
    fix-it: |
      Decrease the number of discoverable tables by limiting the Stitch database user's access only to tables you want to replicate. You can accomplish this by altering the Stitch database user's privileges in the database.

      Refer to the [documentation for your database]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/#all-database-integrations) for instructions.
