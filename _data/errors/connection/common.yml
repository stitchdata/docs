## Connection refused
connection-refused: &connection-refused
  message: "Connection refused. Check that the hostname and port are correct and that the postmaster is accepting TCP/IP connections."
  id: "connection-refused"
  level: "critical"
  category: "Communication"
  summary: "Connection refused"
  cause: |
    Stitch is unable to connect to the {{ connection }}. This is typically a result of incorrectly entering connection details into Stitch, or a failure to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
  fix-it: |
    - Verify that the **hostname** entered in the {{ app.page-names[settings-page] }} page is correct.
    - Verify that the **port** entered in the {{ app.page-names[settings-page] }} page is correct.
    - Verify that Stitch’s IP addresses are whitelisted.

       **For Amazon RDS databases**: Check that the Security Group and VPC Subnet associated with the database allows access from all Stitch's IP addresses.

## Incorrect type
incorrect-type: &incorrect-type
  id: "database-type"
  level: "critical"
  category: "Incorrect Stitch setup"
  summary: "Database type mismatch"
  message: "We encountered an error while attempting to check the type or version for this {{ connection }}. Please select the correct {{ connection }} type and try again."
  fix-it: "Verify that you’ve selected the correct {{ connection }}  type. If the incorrect {{ connection }}  type was chosen, select the correct {{ connection }} type and try completing the setup again."

databases:
## Can't list databases/table
  - message: "Could not list databases/tables for connection."
    id: "list-databases-tables"
    applicable-to: "All database integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Database user privileges"
    summary: "Unable to list databases and tables"
    cause: "Stitch is unable to access the databases or tables in your database, likely due to insufficient database user privileges."
    fix-it: |
      Verify that the database user authorizing the integration has the necessary privileges for the type of database you’re connecting.

## Unsupported table
  - message: "[table_name] unsupported"
    id: "unsupported-table"
    applicable-to: "All database integrations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Database user privileges or unsupported table format"
    summary: "Unsupported table"
    cause: |
      - Stitch is unable to access the table, or

    fix-it: |
      - Verify that the database user authorizing the integration has the necessary privileges for the type of database you connected
      - Verify that the table is in a supported format for the type of database you connected

## Connection refused
  - <<: *connection-refused
    applicable-to: &all-databases "All database integrations"

## Incorrect type
  - <<: *incorrect-type
    applicable-to: *all-databases
    cause: |
      The database type doesn’t match the database integration you selected in Stitch. 

      For example: You select Microsoft SQL Server in Stitch, but we detect that it’s actually a Microsoft Azure SQL database.
    
## I/O error

## Password failure
  - <<: *password-fail
