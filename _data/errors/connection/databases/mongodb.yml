#    MongoDB Integration Connection Errors   #

## This file contains connection errors specific to 
## MongoDB database integrations.


## Prematurely reached end of file/stream
- message: "Prematurely reached end of file/stream"
  id: "premature-file"
  applicable-to: "MongoDB database integrations"
  level: "critical"
  category: "SSL configuration"
  summary: "Incorrect SSL configuration"
  cause: |
    This error usually means that SSL has been incorrectly configured. Connecting a database integration to Stitch via SSL has two parts: Configuration on the database's server and in the Stitch app. For the connection to be successful, the settings in both Stitch and on the database server must align.

    For example: A MongoDB server doesn't support SSL connections but the SSL option is checked in Stitch. This will result in a connection error.
  fix-it: |
    First, verify if the MongoDB server is configured to support SSL connections. Then:

    - **If SSL connections aren't supported,** make sure the **Connect using SSL** box in Stitch is **unchecked** and try saving the integration again.
    - **If SSL connections are required,** make sure the **Connect using SSL** box in Stitch is **checked** and try saving the integration again.


## Authentication database mismatch

    Timed out after XXXX ms while waiting for a server that matches ReadPreferenceServerSelector{readPreference=primary}.

  level: "critical"
  category: "Database setup"
  summary: "User database authentication mismatch"
  cause: |
    This error usually means that the database entered into the **Authentication Database** field of the {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page is not the same database that's used for user authentication.

    **Note**: If this is an Atlas-based MongoDB instance, the authentication database will be the `admin` database.

    Stitch requires a database user and a MongoDB server with `auth` enabled to create MongoDB connections. When authenticating a user in this way, [MongoDB requires that the user be validated against their authentication database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#authenticate-a-user){:target="new"}.
  fix-it: |
    1. Ensure that the Stitch database user can perform all the required actions on the authentication database, in addition to any other databases that contain data you want to replicate.

         **Note**: If this is an Atlas-based MongoDB instance, the authentication database will be the `admin` database.

    2. Once the Stitch user's permissions have been verified, re-enter the name of the database into the {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page:

         - **For Atlas-based MongoDB instances**, this must be `admin`.
         - **For other MongoDB instances**, enter the name of the authentication database.

    3. When finished, save the integration.
