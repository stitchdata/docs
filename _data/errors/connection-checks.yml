      Verify that the Stitch database user has the necessary permissions for the type of database you’re connecting.

      You can find the permissions in the [Creating a Stitch Database User section of the setup guide for your database](/docs/integrations/databases).

      **Applicable only to MongoDB integrations,** this error usually means that SSL has been incorrectly configured.

      Connecting a database integration to Stitch via SSL has two parts: configuration on the database's server and in the Stitch app. For the connection to be successful, the settings in both Stitch and on the database server must align.

      For example: a MongoDB server doesn't support SSL connections but the SSL option is checked in Stitch. This will result in a connection error.
    fix-it: "First, verify if the MongoDB server is configured to support SSL connections. Then:"
    fix-it-list:
      - item: "**If SSL connections aren't supported,** make sure the **Connect using SSL** box in Stitch is **unchecked** and try saving the integration again."
      - item: "**If SSL connections are required,** make sure the **Connect using SSL** box in Stitch is **checked** and try saving the integration again."

      **Applicable only to MongoDB integrations**, this error usually means that the database entered into the **Database** field of the {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page is not the same database that's used for user authentication.

      Stitch requires a database user and a MongoDB server with `auth` enabled to create MongoDB connections. When authenticating a user in this way, [MongoDB requires that the user be validated against their authentication database](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#authenticate-a-user).

      Currently, Stitch's MongoDB integration currently assumes the database entered in the Integration Settings page is the authentication database. Due to MongoDB's authentication process and Stitch's current functionality, the database entered into Stitch must be the user's authentication database.

      **Note**: This database is only used to create the connection. Stitch will be able to detect any other databases the Stitch user has access to.
    fix-it-list:
      - item: |
          Ensure that the Stitch database user can perform all the required actions on the authentication database, in addition to any other databases that contain data you want to replicate. [See the Create a Mongo Database user section]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/mongodb#create-database-user) of the Mongo setup guide for the full list of requirements.

          **Note**: If this is an Atlas-based MongoDB instance, the authentication database will be the `admin` database.

      - item: |
          Once the Stitch user's permissions have been verified, re-enter the name of the database into the {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page:

            - **For Atlas-based MongoDB instances**, this must be `admin`.
            - **For other MongoDB instances**, enter the name of the authentication database.

      - item: "When finished, save the integration."

  - message: "An error occurred (404) when calling the HeadObject operation: Not Found"
    id: "missing-challenge-file"
    applies-to: "destinations"
    ip-addresses: false
    meaning: |
      **Applicable to Amazon S3 destinations only.** This error occurs when the Stitch [challenge file]({{ link.destinations.setup.amazon-s3 | append: "#verify-bucket-access" }}) isn't found in the specified S3 bucket.

      The challenge file is used to test Stitch's connection to the bucket. Stitch will surface this error if it cannot find the challenge file, whether because the file was removed or never created.
    fix-it: |
      - **If you still have access to the challenge file name**, follow [these instructions]({{ link.destinations.setup.amazon-s3 | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#verify-bucket-access" }}) to create the file in your S3 bucket.
      - **If you no longer have access to the challenge file name**, you'll need to create a new S3 destination [using these instructions]({{ link.destinations.overviews.switch-destination | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

         **Note**: Creating a new destination doesn't mean you'll need to re-replicate all of your data. During the destination change process, you can choose to pick up replication where it left off or to queue a historical re-replication.

      - item: &hostname |
          Verify that the **hostname** entered in the [Destination/Integration] Settings page is correct.

          **For [types]**: check that the port has been removed from the end of the hostname string.
      - item: &port-setting "Verify that the **port setting** entered in the [Destination/Integration] Settings page is correct."

          Verify that Stitch’s IP addresses (see below) are whitelisted.

          **For [types]**: Check that the Security Group and VPC Subnet associated with the database allows access from all Stitch's IP addresses.

      The [destination/database] type doesn’t match the [destination/database] you selected in Stitch. 

      For example: you select [wrong-type] in Stitch, but we detect that it’s actually a PostgreSQL [destination/database].
