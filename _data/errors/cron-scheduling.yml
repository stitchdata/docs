#   Cron Scheduling Errors   #
# -------------------------- #

## This file contains the error messages that can display
## on an integration's settings page when attempting to use
## advanced scheduling, or cron scheduling.

## See: https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/replication/replication-scheduling/advanced-cron-scheduling

errors:
  - message: "This field is required"
    meaning: "When Advanced Scheduling is selected, a valid value must be provided for each field."
    fix-it: |
      If you want to use Advanced Scheduling, enter a valid value for each field: {% for field in expression-fields %}{{ field | capitalize }}{% unless forloop.last == true %}, {% endunless %}{% endfor %}.

      Otherwise, de-select the **Advanced** checkbox to define a Replication Frequency or Anchor Schedule.

  - message: |
      Invalid value: "{EXPRESSION}": Failed to parse int from {CHARACTER}: strconv.Atoi: parsing "{CHARACTER}": invalid syntax"
    meaning: |
      The expression contains an illegal character for a given field. For example: An alphabetical character - such as `H` or `Z` - any field will result in this error.
    fix-it: |
      Verify that each of the fields in the expression contains only its [allowed values and special characters](#cron-expression-field-values).

  - message: |
       Invalid value: "* {VALUE} * * *": End of range ({VALUE}) above maximum ({FIELD MAX VALUE}): {VALUE}
    meaning: |
      A field in the expression contains a numerical value that exceeds the maximum allowed for that field.

      For example: The `minutes` field will only accept values from `0-59`, as an hour only contains 60 minutes.
    fix-it: |
      Verify that each of the fields in the expression contains a numerical value within its limits:

      - `minutes` - `0-59`
      - `hours` - `0-23`
      - `day of month` - `1-31`
      - `day of week` - `0-6`
