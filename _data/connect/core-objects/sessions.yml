     Ephemeral tokens are used to [create a session](https://www.stitchdata.com/docs/stitch-connect/javascript-client) with the Connect JavaScript client. The session will be for the user for whom the API access token was created.

     After the ephemeral token is used to create a session, the created session will expire once terminated or after 12 hours.
