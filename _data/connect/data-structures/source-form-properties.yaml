  Stitch connects to a large, diverse universe of applications, each of which is configured differently. The `properties` objects contain the properties necessary to create a source object.

  For sources, these properties can also be found in the [sourceâ€™s report card form step](#{{ site.data.connect.data-structures.report-cards.source.section }}).
