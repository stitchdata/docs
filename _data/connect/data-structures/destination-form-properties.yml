  Stitch connects to a large, diverse universe of destinations, each of which is configured differently. The `properties` object contain the properties necessary to create a destination object.

  For destinations, these properties can also be found in the [destination's report card form step](#{{ site.data.connect.data-structures.report-cards.destination.section }}).
