fields:

    type: "string"

    internal: false
    category: "anchor-scheduling"

      Defines the time that `frequency_in_minutes` is "anchored" to, which Stitch will use to create the integration's replication schedule. In Stitch, this is referred to as [Anchor Scheduling]({{ link.replication.anchor-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

      This field must contain an [ISO 8601-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target="new"} date. **Note**: When Stitch stores this value, it will be in UTC. You should provide this value in UTC to ensure the desired anchor time is retained.

      For example: You want to create a schedule that is anchored to `1:00PM EST` and runs every 6 hours (`360` minutes). To do this, you can set `anchor_time` to something like `2018-04-30T17:00:00Z` and `frequency_in_minutes` to `360`. This means jobs would run at `23:00:00`, `05:00:00`, `11:00:00`, and so on.

      Defines how often, in minutes, Stitch should attempt to replicate data from a source. Accepted values are:

      - `1` (database sources only)

      {% if cron-scheduling == false %}
      **Note: Advanced Scheduling using Cron is not yet supported for this source.** A value may be submitted for this property if the account is on an Enterprise plan, but Stitch will not use the expression submitted.
      {% endif %}

      A valid Quartz cron expression representing the replication schedule for the integration. Refer to the [Advanced Scheduling documentation]({{ link.replication.advanced-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.

      **Note**: If neither a `cron_expression` or `frequency_in_minutes` property is provided, Stitch will use the source's default `frequency_in_minutes` value (`{{ replication-frequency | remove: " " | remove: "minutes" | remove: "hours" }}`).

      A valid Quartz cron expression representing the replication schedule for the integration. This feature is only available to users on a Stitch Enterprise plan.

      **Note**: If neither a `cron_expression` or `frequency_in_minutes` property is provided, Stitch will use the source's default `frequency_in_minutes` value.

# start_date is in its own list because some non-SaaS sources also use it.

start-date:
  - name: *start-date

    required: true

    category: "extraction"
    description: |
      The date from which Stitch should begin replicating data from {{ connection-name }}. Data from this date forward will be replicated.

      This field must contain an [ISO 8601-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target="new"} date, and the timestamp must be midnight. For example: `2018-01-01T00:00:00Z`
    value: "2018-01-10T00:00:00Z"
