# This file contains the fields that are common to all source connections.

fields:
  - name: "anchor_time"
    type: "string"
    required: false
    description: |
      Defines the time that `frequency_in_minutes` is "anchored" to, which Stitch will use to create the integration's replication schedule. In Stitch, this is referred to as [Anchor Scheduling]({{ link.replication.anchor-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

      This field must contain an [ISO 8601-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target="new"} date. For example: `2018-04-30T03:30:00Z`

      For example: If `anchor_time` is set to `2018-04-30T03:30:00Z` and `frequency_in_minutes` is set to `360`, Stitch will run a replication job for the integration every `360` minutes, starting at `03:30:00`. This means a job would run at `09:30:00`, `15:30:00`, `21:30:00`, etc.
    value: "2018-04-30T03:30:00Z"

  - name: "frequency_in_minutes"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: |
      Defines how often, in minutes, Stitch should attempt to replicate data from {{ integration }}. Accepted values are:

      - `30`
      - `60`
      - `360`
      - `720`
      - `1440`
    value: "360"

  - name: "start_date"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: |
      The date from which Stitch should begin replicating data from {{ integration }}. Data from this date forward will be replicated.

      This field must contain an [ISO 8601-compliant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601){:target="new"} date, and the timestamp must be midnight. For example: `2018-01-01T00:00:00Z`
    value: "2018-01-10T00:00:00Z"
    exclude: "doubleclick-campaign-manager"
