    description: &database-description "The name of the logical database to connect to."
    value: "<DATABASE_NAME>"

  - name: &filterdbs-name "filter_dbs"
    required: false

#    POSTGRESQL DATABASES    #
# -------------------------- #

postgres:
  - name: "dbname"
    required: true
    type: "string"
    description: *database-description
    value: "<DATABASE_NAME>"

  - name: *filterdbs-name
    required: true

    value: ""

  - name: "include_schemas_in_destination_stream_name"
    required: true
    type: "string"
    description: |
      If `true`, the name of the source schema will be included in the destination table name. For example: `<source_schema_name>__<table_name>`. This can help prevent table name collisions when two tables canonicalize to the same name.

      For more info, refer to the [Database Integration Table Name Collisions guide]({{ link.troubleshooting.database-table-name-collisions | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
    value: "false"

# -------------------------- #
#       FEATURE FIELDS       #
# -------------------------- #

# These fields are specific to databases that support certain features.
# The properties listed here will only display for a form property if
# The corresponding doc for that database has a `true` flag for that feature.

binlog-replication:
  - name: "use_log_based_replication"
    required: false
    type: "string"
    description: |
      If `true`, Log-based Incremental Replication will be used as the default Replication Method for tables set to replicate. This choice can be overriden on individual tables at any time.

    required: false
    type: "string"
    description: |
      Defines the unique ID of the server that Stitch will connect to, if using Log-based (binlog) Replication.

      Server IDs must be unique, as MySQL doesn't allow replication to simultaneously occur across multiple connections using the same server ID. For more info about this setting in Stitch, refer to the [MySQL documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/mysql#server-id){:target="new"}.
    value: "<UNIQUE_SERVER_ID>"
    database: "mysql"
