        version: "4"
        response-body: |
          Occurs when a destination ID argument isn't included in the request URL. Below is an incorrectly formatted request URL:

          ```curl
          {{ endpoint.full-url | flatify | replace: "{id","" | remove: right-bracket | strip_newlines }}
          ```

          This is correct:

          ```
          {{ endpoint.full-url | flatify | replace: "{id","86741" | remove: right-bracket | strip_newlines }}
          ```

      - method: "delete"
        condition: "Destination ID contains illegal characters"
        version: "4"
        response-body: |
          Occurs when a destination ID argument includes illegal characters, such as letters. For example:

          ```curl
          {{ endpoint.full-url | flatify | replace: "{id","abc" | remove: right-bracket | strip_newlines }}
          ```
