  ## Stitch JavaScript Client
    default-streams: |
      Sets the default selections for the data structures (tables) to be replicated during the source integration setup. Should be an object of the form `{"table_name": true}`. For example:

      ```json
      "default_streams":{
         "campaigns":true,
         "companies":true
      }
      ```

      Additionally, note that:

      - Only top-levels may be provided
      - If a table name is provided that the integration doesn't support, it will be ignored
      - Values other than `true` will be ignored

    ephemeral-token: "A token that is passed to the [{{ js.name }}]({{ js.section | flatify | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to create a session."

    ephemeral-token-js: |
      The token used to automatically log the user into the Stitch client account. Retrieved by creating a session using the Connect API's [Create a Session endpoint]({{ api.section | flatify | prepend: site.baseurl | append: api.core-objects.sessions.create.anchor }}).

      If the token is not provided, the user may be prompted to sign into their Stitch account.

      The ephemeral token expires one hour after generation. When specified as an argument in a Connect JavaScript function, the ephemeral token is exchanged for a session token, creating a temporary Stitch session for the user. The session expires once terminated or 12 hours after its creation.

  ## Databases & Destinations

    destination-type: |
      The destination type. Must be one of: 

      - `redshift`
      - `postgres`
      - `snowflake`

  ## Integrations
    display-name: "A descriptive name for the source. This will be used to dynamically generate the name corresponding to the schema name or dataset name that the data from this source will be loaded into."

    name: |
      The name of the source connection, dynamically generated from `display_name`. The `name` corresponds to the destination schema name that the data from this source will be loaded into.

      Names must:
        - Contain only lowercase alphanumerics and underscores
        - Be unique within each Stitch client account

    properties: "A source [Properties object]({{ api.data-structures.properties.section }}) corresponding to the value of `type`."

    type: "The source type. For example: `platform.hubspot` or `platform.marketo`."

    type-argument: "A path parameter indicating the `type` of source to retrieve, such as `platform.marketo` or `platform.hubspot`."
