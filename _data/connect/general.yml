    default-streams: |
      Sets the default selections for the data structures (tables) to be replicated during the source integration setup. Should be an object of the form `{"table_name": true}`. For example:

      ```json
      "default_streams":{
         "campaigns":true,
         "companies":true
      }
      ```

      Additionally, note that:

      - Only top-levels may be provided
      - If a table name is provided that the integration doesn't support, it will be ignored
      - Values other than `true` will be ignored

    ephemeral-token: "A token that is passed to the [{{ js.name }}]({{ js.section | flatify | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to create a session."

    ephemeral-token-js: |
      The token used to automatically log the user into the Stitch client account. Retrieved by creating a session using the Connect API's [Create a Session endpoint]({{ api.section | flatify | prepend: site.baseurl | append: api.core-objects.sessions.create.anchor }}).

      If the token is not provided, the user may be prompted to sign into their Stitch account.

      The ephemeral token expires one hour after generation. When specified as an argument in a Connect JavaScript function, the ephemeral token is exchanged for a session token, creating a temporary Stitch session for the user. The session expires once terminated or 12 hours after its creation.

    destination-type: |
      {% assign all-connect-docs = site.developer-files | where:"product-type","connect" %}

      {% assign destination-forms = all-form-properties | where:"form-type","destination" | sort:"api-type" %}

      The destination type. Must be one of:

  # This string has placeholders because it's used for both source and destination documentation.
  # When this is used, replace filters have to be used to display the correct copy
  # Ex: {{ connect.common.attributes.type-argument | replace: "[TYPE]","destination" | replace: "[TYPE-1]","s3" | replace: "[TYPE-2]","redshift" }}
