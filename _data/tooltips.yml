#      General Tooltips      #
# -------------------------- #

analysis-integration: “Analysis integrations are third-party tools you can layer on top of your data warehouse to query, visualize, and otherwise explore your data.”

anchor-scheduling: "A type of replication scheduling where an integration's Replication Frequency is anchored to a time you select."

attribution-window: "An attribution or conversion window is the amount of time for attributing results to ads, and the lookback period after those actions occur during which ad results are counted."

api-quota: "An API quota refers to the total number of API requests that can be made in a given period of time."

api-rate-limit: "An API's rate limit refers to how often requests can be made in a given period of time. "

append-only: "Existing rows are never updated. When new or updated data is loaded, it will be appended to the end of the table as a new row."

certified-integration: "Certified integrations will receive commercial support, which is a guarantee that Stitch will fix bugs and adapt to new versions of third-party APIs."

column-selection: "The ability to select individual columns for replication in the Stitch interface. If column selection is unavailable, all columns will be set to replicate by default."

community-integration: "Maintenance of Community integrations will be performed by the Singer community. This includes fixing bugs and adapting to new versions of third-party APIs."

connection-check: "A test performed by Stitch that checks the configuration of a source's connection parameters."

database-integration: “Database integrations are just that - databases. This includes MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and others.”

destination: "Destination is the Stitch word for ‘data warehouse.’ A data warehouse is a central repository for data accumulated from a variety of sources."

extraction-logs: "Logs detailing the Extraction phase of the replication process for a given integration. Includes error info, should an error occur."

historical-replication-job: "A Stitch replication job that replicates historical data."

historical-sync: "Historical syncs are how far back from the Stitch connection date, by default, Stitch will fetch historical data."

loading-reports: "Reports detailing the Loading phase of the replication process for a given integration. Includes the number of rows loaded for each table and error info, should an error occur."

primary-key: "Primary Keys are used to identify unique rows within a table and ensure that only the most recently updated version of that record appears in your data warehouse."

replication-job: "The three-step process by which Stitch replicates data. A replication job includes three distinct steps: Extraction, preparation, and loading."

replication-frequency: "Replication Frequency refers to how often - based on the time of the last completed attempt - Stitch will attempt to replicate data from a data source."

replication-key: "Replication Keys are columns used to identify new and updated data for replication. These are typically integer, datetime, or timestamp columns."

row-count: "A replicated row is any row that moves through Stitch, whether it's a new addition, updated record, or a copy of an updated record. This includes rows in nested subtables."

saas-integration: “SaaS integrations are cloud-based third-party services like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Trello.”

session: "A browser session in the Stitch web application."

source: "A database, API, or other data application that Stitch replicates data from. Outside of Connect, known as an 'integration'."

stitch-client-account: "An individual account for the Stitch web application."

structure-sync: "The first step in the replication process, this process takes place during the Extraction phase of a replication job. A structure sync detects the tables and columns available in the source, along with any changes to the structure of those tables and columns."

table-selection: "The ability to select individual tables for replication in the Stitch interface. If table selection is unavailable, all tables and all the columns they contain will be set to replicate by default."

updated-at-rep: "Updated or Modified At is a type of Incremental Replication that uses datetime or timestamp columns to detect new and updated data."

upsert: "An action that updates an existing row in a data warehouse table with new or modified data."

whitelisting-feature: "Whitelisting is a feature that allows you to select specific tables and columns for replication."

#     Replication Methods    #
# -------------------------- #

append-only-rep: "Append-Only Replication is a type of Incremental Replication where newly replicated data is appended to the end of a table. Existing rows are not updated - updates are added to the end of the table as new rows."

full-table-rep: "Full Table Replication is a replication method in which all rows in a table - including new, updated, and existing - are replicated during every replication job."

incremental-rep: "Incremental Replication is a replication method in which new or updated data is replicated during a replication job."

key-based-incremental-rep: "Key-based Incremental Replication is a replication method in which Stitch identifies new and updated data using a column called a Replication Key."

log-based-incremental-rep: "Log-based Incremental Replication is a replication method in which Stitch identifies modifications to records - including inserts, updates, and deletes - using a database's binary log files."

case: "Indicates if the data warehouse is case sensitive or case insensitive."

column-limit: "The maximum number of columns a table can have."

column-name-limit: "The maximum number of allowed characters a column name can have."

decimal-range: "The maximum number of places decimal data types can have. 'Not Applicable' means the destination doesn't have decimal support."

destination-incompatibilities: "Indicates if there are any possible incompatibilities between this integration and any of Stitch's destination offerings."

destination-rep-methods: "The Replication Methods supported by the data warehouse."

db-type: "The type of database. Analytic excels at analyzing huge volumes of data; Transactional excels at processing."

db-views: "Indicates if Stitch supports replicating views from this database integration."

fully-managed: "This indicates if the destination provider includes routine maintenance and upgrades in their plan. If No, you'll be responsible for performing maintenance tasks."

integration-availability: "Indicates if a free or paid Stitch plan is required to use the integration."

integration-incompatibilities: "Indicates if there are any possible incompatibilities between this destination and any of Stitch's integration offerings."

nested-structure-support: "Indicates if the destination natively supports nested structures."
