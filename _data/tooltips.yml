analysis-integration: “Analysis integrations are third-party tools you can layer on top of your data warehouse to query, visualize, and otherwise explore your data.”

api-quota: "An API quota refers to the total number of API requests that can be made in a given period of time."

api-rate-limit: "An API's rate limit refers to how often requests can be made in a given period of time. "

append-only-rep: "Append-Only Replication is a type of Incremental Replication where newly replicated data is appended to the end of a table. Existing rows are not updated - any updates will be added to the table as new rows."

certified-integration: "Certified integrations will receive commercial support, which is a guarantee that Stitch will fix bugs and adapt to new versions of third-party APIs."

community-integration: "Maintenance of Community integrations will be performed by the Singer community. This includes fixing bugs and adapting to new versions of third-party APIs."

connection-check: "A test performed by Stitch that checks the configuration of a source's connection parameters."

database-integration: “Database integrations are just that - databases. This includes MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, and others.”

destination: “Destination is the Stitch word for ‘data warehouse.’ A data warehouse is a central repository for data accumulated from a variety of sources.”

full-table-rep: "Full Table Replication means that ALL rows in a table - including new, updated, and existing - will be replicated during every replication attempt."

historical-sync: "Historical syncs are how far back from the Stitch connection date, by default, Stitch will fetch historical data."

incremental-rep: "Incremental Replication means that only new or updated data will be replicated during a replication attempt."

primary-key: "Primary Keys are used to identify unique rows within a table and ensure that only the most recently updated version of that record appears in your data warehouse."

replication-frequency: "Replication Frequency refers to how often - based on the time of the last completed attempt - Stitch will attempt to replicate data from a data source."

replication-key: "Replication Keys are columns used to identify new and updated data for replication. These are typically integer, datetime, or timestamp columns."

row-count: "A replicated row is any row that moves through Stitch, whether it's a new addition, updated record, or a copy of an updated record. This includes rows in nested subtables."

saas-integration: “SaaS integrations are cloud-based third-party services like Salesforce, Zendesk, and Trello.”

session: "A browser session in the Stitch web application."

source: "A database, API, or other data application that Stitch replicates data from. Outside of the {{ page.api-name }}, known as an 'integration'."

stitch-client-account: "An individual account for the Stitch web application."

structure-sync: "The first step in the replication process, this process will detect the tables and columns available in the source, along with any changes to the structure of those tables and columns."

updated-at-rep: "Updated or Modified At is a type of Incremental Replication that uses datetime or timestamp columns to detect new and updated data."

whitelisting-feature: "Whitelisting is a feature that allows you to select specific tables and columns for replication."

destination-incompatibilities: "Indicates if there are any possible incompatibilities between this integration and any of Stitch's destination offerings."

destination-rep-methods: "The Replication Methods supported by the data warehouse."

db-type: "The type of database. Analytic excels at analyzing huge volumes of data; Transactional excels at processing."

db-views: "Indicates if Stitch supports replicating views from this database integration."

fully-managed: "This indicates if the destination provider includes routine maintenance and upgrades in their plan. If No, you'll be responsible for performing maintenance tasks."

integration-availability: "Indicates if a free or paid Stitch plan is required to use the integration."

integration-incompatibilities: "Indicates if there are any possible incompatibilities between this destination and any of Stitch's integration offerings."

table-name-limit: "The maximum number of allowed characters a table name can have."

varchar-limit: "The maximum VARCHAR width the data warehouse supports."

whitelisting: "Indicates whether individual tables and/or columns can be selected for replication."
