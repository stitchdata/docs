      - name: "is-deleted"
    examples:
      - job: "initial"
        source: |
          Stitch uses `SELECT` replication to replicate the table in full.
        destination: |
          Stitch loads the table in full.

      - job: "second"
        source: |
          Records `1` and `3` are soft deleted (`is_deleted: true`).

          After the initial replication job, Stitch will switch to using the database's binary log files for replication and its position in the binary log as a Replication Key, or bookmark. 

          The binary log will contain an entry for updating the `is_deleted` values for records `1` and `3`, which Stitch will detect and replicate.
        destination: |
          The `is_deleted` and `updated_at` values are updated for records records `1` and `3`.

#       LOG-BASED, HARD DELETES      #
#------------------------------------#

  - type: "hard"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll demonstrate what happens when a record is hard deleted - or removed entirely - from a source table using {{ replication-method.display-name }}. In this situation, Stitch will use a `TIMESTAMP` column named `{{ system-column.deleted-at }}` to indicate when records have been identified as deleted in the source.

      **Note**: Identifying hard deleted records is dependent on how the record is deleted, as not all event types are recorded by databases in binary logs. For example: If a record is deleted using `TRUNCATE` in a MySQL database, Stitch will not detect the deletion.

      Refer to the [MySQL]() and [PostgreSQL]() documentation for more details.

          If the record is deleted using a command that is recorded by the binary log, the log file will contain an entry for record `2`'s deletion. Stitch will detect and replicate the updated record.
        destination: |
          Record `2` will remain in the table, but have a timestamp in the `{{ system-column.deleted-at }}` column indicating when the deletion took place.

      In this example, we'll demonstrates what happens when a record is hard-deleted - or removed entirely - from the source.

      **Note**: To remove hard deletes from destination tables replicated in this way, you'll need to:

         1. Temporarily drop the table in the destination
         2. Reset the table's Replication Keys
         3. Wait for Stitch to re-create the table during the next replication job

         **These steps must be done in this order**, or you may cause issues with replication.
