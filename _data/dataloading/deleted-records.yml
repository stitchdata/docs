    description: |
      In this example, we'll demonstrate what happens when two records are soft-deleted in a source table using {{ replication-method-display-name }}.
    columns:
      - name: "id"
      - name: "name"
      - name: "is-deleted"
    examples:
      - job: "initial"
        source: &initial-source |
          A table contains three records: `id: 1`, `id: 2`, and `id: 3`.
        extraction: |
          Stitch uses `SELECT` replication to replicate the table in full.
        destination: |
          Stitch loads the table in full.
        tables:
          - location: "source"
            records: &binlog-soft-initial-table
              - id: "1"
                name: "Finn"
                is-deleted: "false"

              - id: "2"
                name: "Jake"
                is-deleted: "false"

              - id: "3"
                name: "Bubblegum"
                is-deleted: "false"

          - location: "destination"
            records: *binlog-soft-initial-table

      - job: "second"
        source: |
          Records `1` and `3` are soft deleted (`is_deleted: true`) using an `UPDATE` event.

          As `UPDATE` is a supported event type for Log-based Replication, log messages describing the modified `is_deleted` values for records `1` and `3` are written to the database's binary log.
        extraction: |
          After the historical replication job, Stitch will read updates for the table from the database's binary logs.

          Stitch reads the log messages for records `1` and `3` and replicates the updated records.
        destination: |
          The `is_deleted` and `updated_at` values are updated for records records `1` and `3`.
        tables:
          - location: "source"
            records: &binlog-soft-initial-table
              - id: "1"
                name: "Finn"
                is-deleted: "true"

              - id: "2"
                name: "Jake"
                is-deleted: "false"

              - id: "3"

#       LOG-BASED, HARD DELETES      #
#------------------------------------#

  - type: "hard"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll demonstrate what happens when a record is hard deleted - or removed entirely - from a source table using {{ replication-method-display-name }}. In this situation, Stitch will use a `TIMESTAMP` column named `{{ system-column.deleted-at }}` to indicate when records have been identified as deleted in the source.

      **Note**: Identifying hard deleted records is dependent on how the record is deleted, as not all event types are recorded by databases in binary logs. For example: If a record is deleted using `TRUNCATE` in a MySQL database, Stitch will not detect the deletion.

      The following event types will be detected by {{ replication-method-display-name }} for database integrations that support this Replication Method:

      - `INSERT`
      - `UPDATE`
      - `DELETE`

    columns:
      - name: "id"
      - name: "name"
      - name: "_sdc_deleted_at"
    examples:
      - job: "initial"
        source: *initial-source
        extraction: |
          Stitch uses `SELECT` replication to replicate the table in full.

          - location: "source"
            records: &binlog-hard-initial-table
              - id: "1"
                name: "Finn"

              - id: "2"

          - location: "destination"
            records: *binlog-hard-initial-table
      - job: "second"
        source: |
          Record `2` is hard deleted using a `DELETE` event.

          As `DELETE` is a supported event type for Log-based Replication, log messages describing the delete of record `2` are written to the database's binary log.
        extraction: |
          After the historical replication job, Stitch will read updates for the table from the database's binary logs.

          Stitch reads the log message for record `2` and identifies the record as deleted.
        destination: |
          Record `2` is overwritten with the exception of its Primary Key value. Stitch will place a timestamp in the `{{ system-column.deleted-at }}` column to indicate when the deletion took place.

      In this example, we'll demonstrates what happens when a record is hard-deleted - or removed entirely - from the source.

      **Note**: To remove hard deletes from destination tables replicated in this way, you'll need to:

         1. Temporarily drop the table in the destination
         2. Reset the table's Replication Keys
         3. Wait for Stitch to re-create the table during the next replication job

      How hard deletes are handled in an Append-Only destination depends on the **integration**:

      - **If you can define Replication Methods for an integration**, Stitch will delete and re-create tables in a single transaction. This is the scenario described in the **Hard deletes** tab for this section.
