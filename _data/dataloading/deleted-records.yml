      In this example, we'll demonstrate what happens when two records are soft-deleted in the source. This table uses the `is_deleted` column as a deletion flag, which will be `true` if the record is deleted.
    columns:
      - name: "id"
      - name: "updated-at"
      - name: "is-deleted"
    examples:
      - job: "initial"
        source: "Stitch replicates the entire table, saving `updated_at: 2018-07-27 12:07:00` as the maximum Replication Key value."
        destination: "Stitch loads the entire table in full."

        source: |
          Records `1` and `3` are soft deleted (`is_deleted: true`). The Replication Key value (`updated_at`) is updated.

          Stitch replicates all records with an `updated_at` value `>= 2018-07-27 12:07:00`.
        destination: "The `is_deleted` and `updated_at` values are updated for records `1` and `3`."
