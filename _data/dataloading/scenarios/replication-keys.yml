  Scenarios involving Replication Keys and how data is loaded as a result.

## Replication Key contains NULLs
null-rep-keys:
  heading: "a Replication Key column contains NULLs?"
  anchor: "null-rep-keys"
  if: "A table using Key-based Incremental Replication is replicated where the Replication Key column contains `NULL` values."
  then: |
    - **During the initial job**, the table will be created and all rows will be replicated.
    - **During subsequent jobs**, only rows with populated Replication Keys will be replicated and persisted to {{ destination.display_name }}.
