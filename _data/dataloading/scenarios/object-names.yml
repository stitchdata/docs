  Scenarios involving object identifiers in the destination, including naming limitations and transformations.


## Table name is too long
table-name-limit: 
  heading: "a table name exceeds the destination's maximum length?"
  anchor: "table-name-limit"
  if: "A table name contains more characters than allowed by {{ destination.display_name }}."
  then: "{{ destination.display_name }} will reject all data for the table."
  fix-it: |
    If possible, change the table name in the source to be less than {{ destination.display_name }}'s character limit of {{ destination-reference.destination-details.table-name-length }}.

## Column names contain MiXeDCaSe
mixed-case-column-name:
  heading: "a column name is mixed-case?"
  anchor: "mixed-case-column-name"
  if: "A column is replicated that has a mixed-case name."
  # then: 

## Column names contain spaces
column-name-spaces:
  heading: "a column name contains spaces?"
  anchor: "column-name-with-spaces"
  if: "A column is replicated that has a name with spaces."
  # then:

## Column name contains unsupported special characters
column-name-special-char:
  heading: "a column name contains special characters?"
  anchor: "column-name-special-char"
  if: "A column is replicated with a name that contains unsupported special characters."
  then: "{{ destination.display_name }} will remove special characters."

## Column name begins with a non-letter character
column-name-starts-non-letter:
  heading: "a column name begins with a non-letter?"
  anchor: "column-name-starts-non-letter"
  if: "A column is replicated with a name that begins with a non-letter."
  then: "This scenario is unremarkable to {{ destination.display_name }}."

## Duplicate field names
duplicate-field-names:
  heading: "two column names canonicalize to the same name?"
  anchor: "duplicate-field-names"
  if: |
    Two columns are replicated that canonicalize to the same name.
  then: |
    For example: A table containing both `CustomerId` and `customerid` columns.

    {{ destination.display_name }} will reject the records and create a log for the rejected records in the `_sdc_rejected` table in that integration's schema.
  fix-it: |
    If possible, re-name one of the columns in the source so that both column names will be unique when replicated to {{ destination.display_name }}.

## Column name is too long
column-name-limit: 
  heading: "a column name exceeds the destination's maximum length?"
  anchor: "column-name-limit"
  if: "A column name contains more characters than allowed by {{ destination.display_name }}."
  then: "{{ destination.display_name }} will reject columns with names that exceed the column character limit. Other columns in the table will persist to {{ destination.display_name }}."
  fix-it: |
    If possible, change the column name in the source to be less than {{ destination.display_name }}'s character limit of {{ destination-reference.destination-details.column-name-length }}.
