  Scenarios involving modifications made to the destination, such as the application of workload/performance management features or user privilege changes.

## Customer applies indexes to Stitch-generated columns
apply-indices:
  heading: "indices are applied to Stitch-generated columns in the destination?"
  anchor: "apply-indices"
  
  if: "Indices are applied to Stitch-generated columns in the destination."
  then: "Stitch will respect the index application."

## Customer applies SORT / DIST Keys to Stitch-generated columns
sort-dist-keys:
  heading: "SORT and/or DISTRIBUTION Keys are applied to Stitch-generated columns in the destination?"
  anchor: "sort-dist-keys"

  if: "SORT and/or DISTRIBUTION Keys are applied to Stitch-generated columns in the destination."
  then: "This is not applicable to {{ destination.display_name }}."

## Customer switches to a new destination of the same type
switch-destination-same-type:
  heading: "I switch to a different destination of the same type?"
  anchor: "switch-destination-same-type"

  if: "You switch to a different destination of the same type."
  then: |
    This means the destination type is still {{ destination.display_name }}, Stitch may just be connected a different database in {{ destination.display_name }}.

    - **For tables using Key-based or Log-based Incremental Replication**, replication will continue using the Replication's Key last saved maximum value. To re-replicate historical data, resetting Replication Keys is required.
    - **For tables using Full Table Replication**, the table will be fully replicated into the new destination during the next successful job.
    - **For webhook integrations,** some data loss may be possible due to the continuous, real-time nature of webhooks. Historical data must either be backfilled or re-played.

## Customer revokes Stitch's schema/table permissions
revoke-stitch-schema-table-permissions:
  heading: "I revoke Stitch's permissions to my destination?"
  anchor: "revoke-stitch-schema-table-permissions"

  if: "You revoke Stitch's schema and/or table permissions to {{ destination.display_name }}."
  then: "Data will fail to load and you will be notified."
  fix-it: "Verify and, if necessary, re-grant the Stitch user's permissions."

## Customer revokes Stitch's warehouse access
revoke-stitch-warehouse-access:
  heading: "I revoke Stitch's access to my destination?"
  anchor: "revoke-stitch-warehouse-access"

  if: "You revoke Stitch's access to {{ destination.display_name }} entirely."
  then: "Data will fail to load and you will be notified."
  fix-it: "Re-authorize Stitch's access to {{ destination.display_name }} by ensuring the Stitch user's credentials are correct and the required permissions are granted."
