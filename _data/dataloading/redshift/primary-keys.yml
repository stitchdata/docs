## Scenario data lives here: _data/dataloading/scenarios/primary-keys.yml
   ## NOTE: If something is commented out and marked as 'uses default',
   ## That means the copy for that thing lives in the file mentioned above.

## Error data lives here: _data/errors/loading/redshift.yml

## Data arrives without a Primary Key:
- id: no-pk
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: |
      - **Initial job**: Table is created without Primary Key and no `NOT NULL` columns.
      - **Subsequent jobs**: If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be added to the table in an Append-Only fashion.

        If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Data arrives with single Primary Key:
- id: single-pk
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: |
      - **Initial job:** Table is created without Primary Key and no `NOT NULL` columns. Primary Key info is stored as a comment on the table.

         **Note**: Incorrectly altering or removing a table's Primary Key comment will result in issues with replication.

      - **Subsequent jobs:** If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be de-duped based on the Primary Key column and upserted into the table.

        If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each sync.


## Data arrives with MULTIPLE Primary Keys:
- id: multiple-pks
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default 
  then:
    v1: |
      - **Initial job**: Table is created without Primary Key and no `NOT NULL` columns. Primary Key info is stored as a comment on the table.

         **Note**: Incorrectly altering or removing a table's Primary Key comment will result in issues with replication.

      - **Subsequent jobs**: If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be de-duped based on the Primary Key columns and upserted into the table.

        If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Primary Key column is changed in the warehouse:
- id: pk-column-change
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: |
      If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be added to the table in an Append-Only fashion.

      If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Primary Key column is removed in the warehouse:
- id: remove-pk-column
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: "Data will continue to be loaded into the table in an Append-Only fashion."
