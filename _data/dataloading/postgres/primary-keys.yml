## Scenario data lives here: _data/dataloading/scenarios/primary-keys.yml
   ## NOTE: If something is commented out and marked as 'uses default',
   ## That means the copy for that thing lives in the file mentioned above.

## Error data lives here: _data/errors/loading/postgres.yml

## Data arrives without a Primary Key:
- id: no-pk
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: &primary-keys |
      - **Initial job**: Table is created without Primary Key and `NOT NULL` constraints.
      - **Subsequent jobs**: If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be added to the table in an Append-Only fashion.

        If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Data arrives with single Primary Key:
- id: single-pk
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: |
      - **Initial job:** Table is created with Primary Key constraint (`table_name_pkey`). Primary Key column has `NOT NULL` constraint.
      - **Subsequent jobs:** If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be de-duped based on the Primary Key column and upserted into the table.

        If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Data arrives with MULTIPLE Primary Keys:
- id: multiple-pks
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default 
  then:
    v1: |
      - **Initial job:** Table is created with Primary Key constraint (`table_name_pkey`). Primary Key columns have `NOT NULL` constraint.
      - **Subsequent jobs:** If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be de-duped based on the Primary Key column and upserted into the table.

        If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Primary Key column is changed in the warehouse:
- id: pk-column-change
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: |
      If using Key-based Incremental or Log-based Incremental Replication, data will be added to the table in an Append-Only fashion.

      If using Full Table Replication, the table will be overwritten in its entirety during each job.


## Primary Key column is removed in the warehouse:
- id: remove-pk-column
  rejectable: false
  # if: uses default
  then:
    v1: "Data will be loaded into the table in an Append-Only fashion."
