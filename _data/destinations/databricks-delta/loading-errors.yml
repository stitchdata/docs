    summary: "Mismatched Amazon S3 and Stitch account regions"
    cause: "The Amazon S3 bucket isn't in the same AWS region as your Stitch account."
    fix-it: |
      Use an Amazon S3 bucket that's in the same AWS region as your Stitch account. Currently, all Stitch accounts are in the `us-east-1` region. Your S3 bucket must be created in this region to use Databricks Delta Lake as your destination.
