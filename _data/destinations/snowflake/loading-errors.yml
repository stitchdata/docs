primary-key-change: &primary-key-change "Keys for table do not match Primary Keys of incoming data"

all:
## Primary Key change not allowed
  - message: *primary-key-change
    id: "pk-change-not-permitted"
    applicable-to: "Snowflake destinations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Primary Keys"
    category-doc: "{{ link.destinations.storage.primary-key-system-table | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
    summary: "Primary Key change is not permitted"
    cause: |
      The Primary Keys of incoming data don't match the Primary Keys of the table in the destination.

      This can be caused by:

      1. The Primary Keys being changed in the source, or
      2. The [`{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-primary-keys.name }}` table]({{ link.destinations.storage.primary-key-system-table | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is altered or dropped
    fix-it: |
      Reset the table(s) mentioned in the error. This will queue a full re-replication of the table(s), which will ensure Primary Keys are correctly captured and used to de-dupe data when loading.
