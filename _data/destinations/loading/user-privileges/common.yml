#   COMMON DESTINATION PRIVILEGES AND DOCS   #
# -------------------------------------------#

# This file contains reasons for Stitch required permissions
# that are common to multiple destinations.

# ----------------------------------- #
#  FOR POSTGRESQL-BASED DESTINATIONS  #
# ----------------------------------- #

# Common to any PostgreSQL-based destination.

postgresql:
  create-database-reason: |
    Required to create the necessary database objects to load and store your data.

    `CREATE` permissions on the database are required to successfully load data. When Stitch loads data, it will run a `CREATE SCHEMA IF NOT EXISTS` command, which will create a schema if it doesn't already exist. To run this command, the Stitch user must have the `CREATE ON DATABASE` permission.

    **Note**: The `CREATE ON SCHEMA` permission is not a sufficient alternative for `CREATE ON DATABASE`. [As outlined in {{ page.display_name }}'s documentation]({{ destination-user-setup.defaults.doc-links.create-database | flatify }}){:target="new"}, this permission only allows a user to create objects within a schema, but not the schema itself.

  select-systems-tables-reason: |
    Required to select rows from tables in the `{{ privilege.schema }}` schema. Prior to loading data, Stitch will use the data in this schema to verify the existence and structure of integration schemas and tables.

    {% if page.display_name == "Heroku" %}For {{ page.display_name }} destinations, access to the `{{ privilege.schema }}` is granted by default to the main database user.{% endif %}

    **Note**: Stitch will only ever read data from systems tables.

## The SQL commands for setting up a PostgreSQL user.

  sql-commands:
    create-user: |
      CREATE USER <stitch_username> WITH PASSWORD '<password>';

    create-database: |
      GRANT CREATE ON DATABASE <database_name> TO <stitch_username>

    select-systems-tables: |
      GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA information_schema TO <stitch_username>

      GRANT SELECT ON ALL TABLES IN SCHEMA pg_catalog TO <stitch_username>

#   STEPS FOR CREATING USER  #
# -------------------------- #

## The copy that goes along with each step for creating the PostgreSQL user.

  setup-steps:
    create-user: |
      After connecting, run this command to create the user:

    create-database: |
      Next, you'll assign the `CREATE` permissions to the user. For `<database_name>`, enter the name of the database where all Stitch-replicated data should be loaded.

      **Note**: This must be a pre-existing database.

    systems-tables: |
      **If you restricted access to the system tables**, you'll also need to run the following commands to grant the Stitch user `SELECT` permissions.
