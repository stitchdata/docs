## This file contains loading errors specific to Amazon Redshift destinations.

## Table owner
- message: "ERROR: must be owner of relation [TABLE_NAME]"
  id: "table-owner"
  applicable-to: &redshift-destinations "Amazon Redshift destinations"
  level: "critical"
  category: "Database user privileges"
  summary: "Insufficient table privileges"
  cause: |
    Stitch is not the owner of a table in Amazon Redshift, which is required to perform functions necessary to load data.
  fix-it: &all-privileges |
    Verify that the database user authorizing the connection has all the required privileges as outlined in the [Amazon Redshift setup instructions]({{ link.destinations.setup.redshift | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#create-database-user" }}).


## Permission denied for schema
- message: "ERROR: permission denied for schema [SCHEMA_NAME]"
  id: "schema-permission-denied"
  applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
  level: "critical"
  category: "Database user privileges"
  summary: "Insufficient schema privileges"
  cause: "Stitch does not have privileges to create tables within a schema in Amazon Redshift."
  fix-it: *all-privileges
   

## Schema creation
- message: "Encountered error while attempting to create new schema."
  id: "error-schema-creation"
  applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
  level: "critical"
  category: "Database user privileges"
  summary: "Cannot create new schema"
  cause: "Stitch is unable to create or load data into a schema in your destination. This is usually due to insufficient database user privileges."
  fix-it: *all-privileges

## Database doesn't exist
- message: |
    FATAL: database "[DATABASE_NAME]" does not exist
  id: "database-does-not-exist"
  applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
  level: "critical"
  category: "Connection settings"
  summary: "Database doesn't exist"
  cause: "Stitch can't find the database in Amazon Redshift that has been entered into the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page."
  fix-it: "Verify that the correct database is entered in the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page of Stitch."

## Resize mode
- message: |
    ERROR: Cannot execute query because system is in resize mode
    Detail: System is in resize mode, and ONLY read-only queries are allowed to execute.
  id: "resize-mode"
  applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
  level: "critical"
  category: "End-user destination change"
  summary: "System is in resize mode"
  cause: |
    Someone adjusted (up or down) the number of nodes of your Amazon Redshift instance and Amazon is currently applying that change.
  fix-it: "This is a transient issue. Stitch should be able to resume loading data once the resize is completed."


## Dependent views
- message: |
    ERROR: cannot drop table [SCHEMA_NAME].[TABLE_NAME] column type because other objects depend on it
    Hint: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
  id: "dependent-views"
  applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
  level: "critical"
  category: "Dependent views"
  category-doc: "{{ link.troubleshooting.view-dependency-errors | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
  summary: "Dependent views"
  cause: |
    Stitch is attempting to widen a `VARCHAR` column and can't because a view is built on top of the table.
  fix-it: |
    Temporarily drop the dependent views, which will allow Stitch to widen the columns. This process usually takes about an hour.
