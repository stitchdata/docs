all:
  - message: "ERROR: must be owner of relation [TABLE_NAME]"
    id: "table-owner"
    applicable-to: &redshift-destinations "Amazon Redshift destinations"
    level: "critical"
    category: "Database user privileges"
    summary: "Insufficient table privileges"
    cause: |
      Stitch is not the owner of a table in Amazon Redshift, which is required to perform functions necessary to load data.
    fix-it: &all-privileges |
      Verify that the database user authorizing the connection has all the required privileges as outlined in the [Amazon Redshift setup instructions]({{ link.destinations.setup.redshift | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#create-database-user" }}).


  ## Permission denied for schema
  - message: "ERROR: permission denied for schema [SCHEMA_NAME]"
    id: "schema-permission-denied"
    applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
    level: "critical"
    category: "Database user privileges"
    summary: "Insufficient schema privileges"
    cause: "Stitch does not have privileges to create tables within a schema in Amazon Redshift."
    fix-it: *all-privileges
     

  ## Schema creation
  - message: "Encountered error while attempting to create new schema."
    id: "error-schema-creation"
    applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
    level: "critical"
    category: "Database user privileges"
    summary: "Cannot create new schema"
    cause: "Stitch is unable to create or load data into a schema in your destination. This is usually due to insufficient database user privileges."
    fix-it: *all-privileges

  ## Database doesn't exist
  - message: |
      FATAL: database "[DATABASE_NAME]" does not exist
    id: "database-does-not-exist"
    applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
    level: "critical"
    category: "Connection settings"
    summary: "Database doesn't exist"
    cause: "Stitch can't find the database in Amazon Redshift that has been entered into the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page."
    fix-it: "Verify that the correct database is entered in the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page of Stitch."

  ## Resize mode
  - message: |
      ERROR: Cannot execute query because system is in resize mode
      Detail: System is in resize mode, and ONLY read-only queries are allowed to execute.
    id: "resize-mode"
    applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
    level: "critical"
    category: "End-user destination change"
    summary: "System is in resize mode"
    cause: |
      Someone adjusted (up or down) the number of nodes of your Amazon Redshift instance and Amazon is currently applying that change.
    fix-it: "This is a transient issue. Stitch should be able to resume loading data once the resize is completed."


  ## Dependent views
  - message: |
      ERROR: cannot drop table [SCHEMA_NAME].[TABLE_NAME] column type because other objects depend on it
      Hint: Use DROP ... CASCADE to drop the dependent objects too.
    id: "dependent-views"
    applicable-to: *redshift-destinations
    level: "critical"
    category: "Dependent views"
    category-doc: "{{ link.troubleshooting.view-dependency-errors | prepend: site.baseurl }}"
    summary: "Dependent views"
    cause: |
      Stitch is attempting to widen a `VARCHAR` column and can't because a view is built on top of the table.
    fix-it: |
      Temporarily drop the dependent views, which will allow Stitch to widen the columns. This process usually takes about an hour.

  ## Disk full
