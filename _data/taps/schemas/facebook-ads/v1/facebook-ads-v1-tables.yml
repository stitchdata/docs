  description: 'The `adcreative` table contains info about the creatives used in ads,

    **This is a Core Object table**.


    #### Limits {#adcreative-table-limits}


    Facebook''s API limits the number of ad creatives that can be retrieved through
    their API to 50,000, which is [documented here](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/ad-creative#limits){:target="new"}.
    If you''re missing data from this table and have more than 50,000 ad creatives
    in your {{ integration.display_name }} account, this may be the cause of the discrepancy.

    #### updated_time and querying


    Because this table uses `updated_time` as part of the Primary Key, query results
    might return various versions of the same adgroup.


    To reflect the latest state of the adgroup, use the latest `updated_time` timestamp.


    #### Deleted ads


    If the **Include data from deleted campaigns, ads, and adsets** box in the integration''s
    settings is checked, this table will include data for deleted ads.

    contain the same fields as this one (`ads_insights`), but include additional dimensions
    to segment the data:


    - [`ads_insights_age_and_gender`](#ads-insights-age-and-gender) - Data segmented
    by age and gender

    - [`ads_insights_country`](#ads-insights-country) - Data segmented by country
