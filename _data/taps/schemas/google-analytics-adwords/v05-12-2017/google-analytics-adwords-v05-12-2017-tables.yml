    The `report` table contains info about your active campaigns and the ads contained within those campaigns.

    **Note**: The attributes in this table are dependent upon the [Metrics and Dimensions selected during setup](#choose-your-data). The schema shown below uses the Metrics and Dimensions from an older version of Stitch's Google AdWords integration.

    #### Table Rows and Data Pagination

    Google AdWords data is paginated on a daily basis. This means a single row in the table pertains to a specific day. The `start_date` and `end_date` columns, which will contain identical values, indicate the day the row is for.

    For example: If `start_date` and `end_date` contain the value `2017-12-12 00:00:00`, the row contains data for December 12, 2017.
