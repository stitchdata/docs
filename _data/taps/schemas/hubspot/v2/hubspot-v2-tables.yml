    ### Contact properties


    If properties have been set for the contact, additional fields beginning with
    `properties__` will be included in the table. **Note**: Contacts will only have
    an entry for a property if that property has been set for the contact''s record.


    {{ integration.display_name }} always types the value of `properties` fields as
    `STRING` despite the property type. [Refer to HubSpot''s documentation for more
    info](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/contacts/contacts-overview){:target="new"}.

    #### Email events and {{ integration.display_name }} permissions


    Replicating this table requires **Super Admin** permissions in {{ integration.display_name
    }}. The Super Admin role is different than the Admin role, which you can read
    more about in [{{ integration.display_name }}''s documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/settings/hubspot-user-roles-guide#admin).


    If this table is selected and you don''t have Super Admin permissions in {{ integration.display_name
    }}, an error similar to the following will surface in the integration''s [Extraction
    Logs]({{ link.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl }}):


    ```

    tap - ERROR b''{"status":"error","message":"This oauth-token (**********) does
    not have proper permissions! (requires any of [email-access])", [...]
