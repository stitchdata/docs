    ### Contact properties


    If properties have been set for the contact, additional fields beginning with
    `properties__` will be included in the table. **Note**: Contacts will only have
    an entry for a property if that property has been set for the contact''s record.


    HubSpot always types the value of `properties` fields as `STRING` despite the
    property type. [Refer to HubSpot''s documentation for more info](https://developers.hubspot.com/docs/methods/contacts/contacts-overview).
