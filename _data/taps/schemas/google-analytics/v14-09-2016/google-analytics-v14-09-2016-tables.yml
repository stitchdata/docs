    The `{{ table.name }}` table will contain the [Metrics and Dimensions selected during integration setup](#schema).

    ### Data pagination

    {{ integration.display_name }} data is paginated on a daily basis. This means that a single row in this table pertains to a specific day. Use the `start_date` and `end_date` columns to identify what day the row is for.

    ### Primary keys

    The Primary Key for this table is a composite key made up of all **Dimension columns** and the `start_date` and `end_date` columns.

    For example: If `referralPath` and `country` were Dimension columns in the table, both columns, along with `start_date` and `end_date` would make up the Primary Key for the table.
