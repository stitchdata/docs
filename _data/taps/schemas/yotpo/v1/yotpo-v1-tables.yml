    #### Attribution window {#email-attribution-window}


    When Stitch replicates data for this table, it will use an attribution window
    of {{ integration.attribution-window }} to fetch updated email statistics such
    as opens, clicks, etc. This means that every time a replication job runs, the
    last 30 days'' worth of data will be replicated for this table.


    Refer to the [Replication](#replication) section for more info and examples of
    how the attribution window is used to query for data.
