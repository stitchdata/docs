  description: "For every report you create in the integration's settings page, Stitch\
    \ will create a corresponding table in your destination. The table will contain\
    \ the [metrics and dimensions you select](#track-data), along with a few columns\
    \ Stitch requires for replication.\n\n**Note**: Every row in this table pertains\
    \ to a specific day. Use the `start_date` and `end_date` columns to identify what\
    \ day the row is for.\n\nThe `{{table.table-details.primary-key}}` column is a\
    \ Stitch-generated SHA 256 hash that should be used as a Primary Key. The hash\
    \ consists of a UTF-8 encoded JSON list containing:\n\n  - The account ID, web\
    \ property ID, and profile ID of the associated report\n  - Pairs of `ga:dimension_name`\
    \ and `dimension_value`\n  - The `start_date` and `end_date` values for the record,\
    \ in `YYYY-mm-dd` format\n"
