- name: events
  description: 'The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about [events](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events){:target="new"}.
    When an  event occurs, a new event object is created. This table acts as the history
    of an object, allowing you to see how it has changed over time.


    For example: When an invoice is created, an `invoice.created` event is created.
    When the draft invoice is finalized and updated to be open, an `invoice.finalized`
    event is created. When the invoice is sent to the customer, an `invoice.sent`
    event is created.


    For more info about this table and how data is replicated, refer to the [Replication](#replication)
    section. Additionally, refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}''s documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"}
    for info about event types and the objects they describe.

    #### Invoice line items


    Full records for the line items associated with an invoice can be found in the
    [`invoice_line_items`](#invoice_line_items) table. To replicate these records,
    you must set this table and the `invoice_line_items` table to replicate.

    in invoices.


    **Note**: In order to replicate invoice line item data, the [`invoices`](#invoices)
    table must also be set to replicate.


    #### Invoice line item replication


    To replicate invoice line items, Stitch will use the Replication Key of the corresponding
    invoice in the [`invoices`](#invoices) table to detect new and updated records.
    This means that any time an invoice is updated, its associated line items will
    also be replicated.


    For example: An invoice with five line items is updated when its status changes
    from `draft` to `open`. The record in `invoices` will be replicated, as will the
    records for its five line items. In this example, a total of six records will
    be replicated.
