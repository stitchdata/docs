    #### Metafield replication and resource types {#metafield-replication-and-resources}


    **By default, this table will include only shop-level metafield data**. To replicate
    the metafields for a given resource type, this table and the table for the resource
    must be set to replicate.


    For example: To replicate metafield data for Orders, the `orders` table must also
    be set to replicate.


    Metafield data is available for [`customers`](#customers), [`products`](#products),
    and [`orders`](#orders).
