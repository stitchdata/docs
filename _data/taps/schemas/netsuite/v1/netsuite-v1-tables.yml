    permission for accessing location data.

  description: 'For each custom record type in {{ integration.display_name }}, a table

    Custom record tables are named `{{ table.name }}`, where `[custom_record_name]`
    is the value of the ID field in the Custom Record Setup page in {{ integration.display_name
    }}.


    For example: If a custom record were named `promo discount` in {{ integration.display_name
    }}, the corresponding table for those records would be named `{{ table.name |
    replace: "[custom_record_name]","promo_discount" }}`. If the ID field in the Custom
    Record Setup page is left blank, {{ integration.display_name }} will auto-assign
    a numerical ID to the record. In Stitch, the table for the custom record would
    then be something like `customrecord_123`, where `123` is the ID auto-assigned
    by {{ integration.display_name }}.


    **Note**: The Replication Method Stitch uses to replicate custom record types
    depends on how custom records are configured in {{ integration.display_name }}.
    Refer to the [Custom records](#custom-records) section for more info.

    A manufacturing routing is a template that contains a list of steps required to
    build an assembly item. Each step is in a sequential order necessary to complete
    the operational sequence for completing the assembly. After you have created a
    routing record, that routing can be selected on a work order to direct the completion
    of the assembly. The routing determines the work center, cost template, labor
    resources, and machine resources that will be used during the assembly.
