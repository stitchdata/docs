    After a WIP work order that has a designated routing is saved in {{ integration.display_name
    }}, manufacturing operation tasks are created based on the routing. Each of these

    A manufacturing routing is a template that contains a list of steps required to
    build an assembly item. Each step is in a sequential order necessary to complete
    the operational sequence for completing the assembly. After you have created a
    routing record, that routing can be selected on a work order to direct the completion
    of the assembly. The routing determines the work center, cost template, labor
    resources, and machine resources that will be used during the assembly.
