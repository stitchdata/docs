tables:
- name: events
  description: '`{{ table.name }}_[project_id]` tables contain info about the events
    logged in your {{ integration.display_name }} projects.


    **Note**: Each event table will have the project ID appended. For example: If
    a project has an ID of `168342`, the events table for the project will be named
    `events_168432`.

- name: merge_ids
  description: '`{{ table.name }}_[project_id]` tables contain info about merged users.
    These are users whose records have been merged with other user records to eliminate
    duplicates.


    For example: If an anonymous user logs events anonymously before signing in, they
    will go from being anonymous to a recognized user. Without merging the user''s
    records, it''ll look like two users with two sets of events, rather than one user
    completing a series of events.


    For more info on how {{ integration.display_name }} handles merging users, [refer
    to their documentation](https://amplitude.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115003135607){:target="new"}.


    **Note**: Each table will have the project ID appended. For example: If a project
    has an ID of `168342`, the merged ID table for the project will be named `merge_ids_168432`.
