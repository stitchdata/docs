    The schema for this table is dynamic, meaning that the columns Stitch detects
    are dependent upon the properties provided upon upload in {{ integration.display_name
    }}. For every property available in {{ integration.display_name }} for `{{ table.name
    }}` records, Stitch will display a column in the integration''s **Tables to Replicate**
    tab.

    \ schema for this table is dynamic, meaning that the columns Stitch detects are\
    \ dependent upon the properties provided upon upload in {{ integration.display_name\
    \ }}. For every property available in {{ integration.display_name }} for `{{ table.name\
    \ }}` records, Stitch will display a column in the integration's **Tables to Replicate**\
    \ tab.\n\n#### Replication with attribution window {#export-events-attribution-window}\n\
    \nThis table is replicated using the **Attribution Window** value defined in the\
    \ integration's settings page. Refer to the [Replication section](#attribution-windows-extraction)\
    \ for more info.\n\n#### Distinct events and loading behavior {#export-events-loading-behavior}\n\
    \nAs Stitch doesn't use a Primary Key for this table, data will be loaded using\
    \ [Append-Only loading]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend:\
    \ site.baseurl }}). This means you may see duplicate records in your destination,\
    \ which requires a querying strategy that selects the latest version of each record.\n\
    \nStitch takes this approach because it's possible to track events without a `distinct_id`.\
    \ In {{ integration.display_name }}, `distinct_id` [is used to identify a unique\
    \ user](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004509406-Distinct-IDs-){:target=\"\
    new\"}:\n\n> Mixpanel\u2019s client-side tracking libraries automatically assign\
    \ a distinct_id to a user when they first visit a website or an application that\
    \ has Mixpanel installed. Distinct_id should not contain any special characters\
    \ such as forward slashes, as it will break the URL.\n> Distinct_ids can and often\
    \ should be sent in server-side implementations as well.\n\nIn order for Stitch\
    \ to replicate records' `distinct_id` attributes, your server-side {{ integration.display_name\
    \ }} implementation must send them with tracked events. If the server-side implementation\
    \ doesn't do this, this attribute will be `null`.\n\nPrevious versions of Stitch's\
    \ {{ integration.display_name }} integration used `distinct_id` as part of a composite\
    \ Primary Key for this table. However, due to the possibility of this attribute\
    \ being `null`, Stitch no longer uses a Primary Key for this table, as `null`\
    \ values in Primary Key columns will prevent successful Extraction. \n\nWhen working\
    \ with `exports` data in your destination, you'll need to use a querying strategy\
    \ that accounts for the Append-Only loading used by this table. We recommend using\
    \ the following columns to de-duplicate records, along with the approach outlined\
    \ in the [Querying Append-Only tables guide]({{ link.replication.append-only-querying\
    \ | prepend: site.baseurl }}):\n\n- `distinct_id`\n- `event`\n- `time`\n"
