    #### Conversation Parts

    To reconstruct an entire conversation, use the `conversation_parts` associated
    with the conversation. These are the individual elements - actions, messages,
    and so on - that make up a conversation.


    If your destination doesn''t natively support nested data structures, a subtable
    named `conversations__conversation_parts` will be created. More info on this table
    can be found below.
