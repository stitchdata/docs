  description: 'The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the subscriptions
    your customers have subscribed to. A subscription is a recurring item that customers
    are billed for, such as a plan or addon. It may also contain discount items.


    **Note**: {{ integration.display_name }} [does not update the `updated_at`](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions#subscription_updated_at){:target="new"}
    value when the following attributes on a subscription are modified:


    - `due_invoices_count`

    - `due_since`

    - `total_dues`


    Because of this functionality and Stitch''s use of this value as a [Replication
    Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}), updates made to
    subscriptions where only these attributes are modified may not be detected. You
    should ensure that another attribute on the subscription is also modified to ensure
    that the `updated_at` value is updated, which will allow Stitch to detect and
    replicate the record.
