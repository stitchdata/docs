- name: time_entries
  description: 'The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about time entries. **Note**:
    This table uses an attribution window to replicate data. Refer to the [Replicating
    time entry data](#replicating-time-entry-data) section for more info.


    #### Time entries and user permissions {#time-entries-user-permissions}


    The time entries Stitch replicates are dependent upon the user whose API token
    is used to create the integration in Stitch. Stitch is only able to access the
    same data as the user whose token is used.


    For example: If the user is unable to access a workspace, or is not an Admin in
    that workspace, Stitch will not be able to replicate time entry data for those
    workspaces. In this case, only the user''s own time entries will be accessible
    by Stitch.


    If data from a workspace is missing, verify that the user whose API token is being
    used in Stitch has Admin permissions in that workspace.
