  description: 'The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about candidates, or individuals
    who''ve been added to your {{ integration.display_name }} account as potential
    fits for job opportunities.


    **Note**: This table must be set to replicate in order to replicate the `candidate_applications`,
    `candidate_offers`, `candidate_referrals`, and `candidate_resumes` tables.


    During Extraction, this table will be replicated before any other selected `candidate_*`
    tables. Then, for every candidate, Stitch will query for every candidate''s applications,
    offers, referrals, and resumes.


    For example: During Extraction, Stitch replicates a candidate with `id: 12345`
    from {{ integration.display_name }}''s `/candidates` endpoint.


    Using `id: 12345`, Stitch will then query for the rest of the candidate''s data:


    - `/candidates/12345/applications`

    - `/candidates/12345/offers`

    - `/candidates/12345/referrals`

    - `/candidates/12345/resumes`
