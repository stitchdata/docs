tables:
- name: activities
  description: "The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about various activities\
    \ in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.\n\nAn activity belongs to a\
    \ lead and can represent any type of activity that was performed on a lead or\
    \ its contact. This includes calls, emails, notes, and so on.\n\n#### Attribution\
    \ window {#email-attribution-window}\n When Stitch replicates data for this table,\
    \ it will use an attribution window of {{ integration.attribution-window }} to\
    \ fetch updated activities.\n\n This means that every time a replication job runs,\
    \ the last 24 hours' worth of data will be replicated for this table. This is\
    \ because {{ integration.display_name }} doesn't provide a way to query for activites\
    \ based on a modification time, only when activities are created. A list of available\
    \ querying methods can be found in [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://developer.close.io/#activities-list-or-filter-all-activity-types){:target=\"\
    new\"}.\n \n Refer to the [Replication](#replication) section for more info and\
    \ examples of how the attribution window is used to query for data.\n"
