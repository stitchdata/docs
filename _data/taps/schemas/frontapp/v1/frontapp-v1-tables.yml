  description: 'The `{{ table.name }}` table contains a list of tag statistics since
    the last completed replication job through the most recent iteration of the defined
    [**Incremental Range**](#add-stitch-data-source) (day or hour).


    This table will include tags in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.


    **Note**: During the historical replication job, all increments (defined using
    the **Incremental Range** setting) since the **Start Date** will be replicated.
    This will result in the first record for this table being an aggregated record
    across all tags.
