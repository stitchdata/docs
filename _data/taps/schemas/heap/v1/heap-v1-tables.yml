  description: 'For every event type defined in {{ integration.display_name }}, a
    table will display in the Stitch app. The name of the table will be the event
    name, which {{ integration.display_name }} will first strip the non-alphanumeric
    characters from. For example: The table name for `Sign Up - Click Link` will be
    transformed into `sign_up_click_link` by {{ integration.display_name }}.


    **Note**: Custom attributes are supported for this table. As {{ integration.display_name
    }} schemas are dynamic, Stitch''s `{{ table.name }}` documentation will only list
    the non-custom attributes outlined in {{ integration.display_name }}''s documentation.
