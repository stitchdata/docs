    **Supported**. An additional column (`deleted`) will be added to objects that support deletions, which indicates the record's deletion status.

    **Deleted data extraction is unsupported by the AQuA API for the following objects**:

    {% assign blacklisted-objects = site.data.taps.extraction.zuora.blacklisted-objects %}
    {% for type in blacklisted-objects.list %}
    {% if type.api contains "deleted" %}
    {% for object in type.objects %}
    - {{ object.name }}
    {% endfor %}
    {% endif %}
    {% endfor %}
