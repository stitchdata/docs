create-user-command: |
  1. Log into your database.
  2. Create a SQL login for the Stitch database user:

     ```sql
     CREATE LOGIN [stitch_username] WITH PASSWORD=’[password]’
     go
     ```

  3. Grant the Stitch user access to the database:

     ```sql
     USE [database]
     go
     ```

  4. Create the Stitch database user and map them to the database:

     ```sql
     CREATE USER [stitch_username] FOR LOGIN 
     go
     ```

  5. Grant the Stitch user `SELECT` privileges.

     To grant `SELECT` privileges to all tables in the database, run this command:

     ```sql
     GRANT SELECT to [stitch_username]
     go
     ```

     If you wish to limit the Stitch user to specific tables, run this command instead:

     ```sql
     GRANT SELECT ON [schema_name].[table_name] TO [stitch_username]
     go
     ```
