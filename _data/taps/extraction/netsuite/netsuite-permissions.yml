      Allows Stitch to query for deleted records in objects that the Stitch user has access to. For example: If access to `transactions` is granted, Stitch can replicate deleted transaction records.

      **Note**: NetSuite only allows `Full` as the level for this permission, but this only grants read-only access to deleted records of any type. For example: If the `Departments` permission is set to `View`, Stitch will be able to see and replicate department data (existing and deleted), but not create, delete, or edit records.
