# Content for the REST/BULK API comparion table in the Salesforce docs.

- name: "Good for replicating"
  rest-api: |
    Small data sets, more frequently
    
    **Note:** Due to the design of {{ integration.display_name }}'s REST API, tracking a large number of columns in a single object can lead to replication issues. See [this guide]({{ link.troubleshooting.salesforce-too-many-columns | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.
  bulk-api: |
    Large data sets, less frequently
    
    While the Bulk API allows for a greater number of tracked fields, {{ integration.display_name }} only allows each batch to be 5MB.

- name: "API quota"
  rest-api: |
    Total usage is calculated by your organization type, the type of licenses held, and the number of licenses.

    Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_api.htm){:target="new"} for more info.
  bulk-api: |
    **Limited to 10,000 batches per day,** regardless of the standard API quota.<br><br>
    
    Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet.meta/salesforce_app_limits_cheatsheet/salesforce_app_limits_platform_bulkapi.htm){:target="new"} for more info.

- name: "Structure sync"
  icon: |
    {{ question-icon | replace: "TOOLTIP", "The first step in the replication process, where Stitch looks for changes to the structure of your data, such as new objects or fields." }}
  rest-api: "Uses the REST API and standard API quota."
  bulk-api: "Uses the REST API and standard API quota."

- name: "Data extraction"
  icon: |
    {{ question-icon | replace: "TOOLTIP", "The second step in the replication process, where Stitch queries for and extracts data from a source." }}
  rest-api: "Uses the REST API standard API quota."
  bulk-api: |
    Uses the Bulk API and Bulk API quota. Each query to an object uses one (1) batch, even if no data is replicated from the object.
    
    If you have any other apps using the Salesforce API, you may consume your quota more quickly.

- name: "Compound fields"
  icon: |
    {{ question-icon | replace: "TOOLTIP", "A compound field is a field that is comprised of other fields. Ex: An address field made up of street, city, state, etc." }}
  rest-api: "Supported"
  bulk-api: |
    [Unsupported by the Bulk API](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000204592&type=1){:target="new"}.

    Tracking the individual fields that make up a compound field - such as `street`, `city`, `state`, for a compound `address` field - will yield the same data.

- name: "Unsupported objects"
  icon: |
    {{ question-icon | replace: "TOOLTIP", "Objects not available for replication through Stitch due to Salesforce API limitations." }}
