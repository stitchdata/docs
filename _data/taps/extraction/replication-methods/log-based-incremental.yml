# -------------------------- #

view-support: |
 [Unsupported]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation-5--views-are-unsupported" }})

structural-changes: |
  [Require manual intervention]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation-4--structural-changes" }})

configuration-requirements: |
  A Microsoft SQL Server, MongoDB, MySQL, Oracle, or PostgreSQL-backed database that:

  1. Supports database log replication
  2. Can be configured to use Stitch's required database settings

other: |
  - Modifications to records must be made using [supported event types]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation-2--database-event-types" }})
  - Logs can age out and stop replication

#     DELETION HANDLING      #
# -------------------------- #

# Indicates the level of support the Replication Method has
# for soft and hard deletes.

soft-deletes:
  support: "supported"
  icon: |
    {{ supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","Supported"}}
  destination: "Record will have an updated deleted flag value, if a flag is available in the source."

hard-deletes:
  support: "sometimes-supported"
  icon: |
    {{ sometimes-supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","Sometimes supported" }}
  destination: |
    Record will have a timestamp value in the `{{ system-column.deleted-at }}` column.

    **Note**: Only deletes completed as part of a [supported event type]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#limitation-2--database-event-types" }}) will be captured.
