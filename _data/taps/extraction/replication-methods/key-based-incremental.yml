#  DATABASE FILE INCREMENTAL #

## This is used in database integrations where files (not tables)
## are replicated.

  - item: "What's replicated during a replication job?"
    other-integrations: "Only new or updated rows in a table."
    this-integration: |
      The entire contents of a modified {{ file-name | default: "file" }}. {{ file-note | flatify }}

  - item: "Are Replication Keys inclusive?"
    other-integrations: "**Yes**. Rows with a Replication Key value **greater than or equal to** the last saved bookmark are replicated."

#    REPLICATION EXAMPLES    #
# -------------------------- #

replication-job-examples:
  - id: "timestamp-date-time-rep-key"
    type: "Timestamp/Date-time Replication Key"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll demonstrate how {{ replication-method.display-name | append: " Replication" }} works with a `TIMESTAMP` (or `DATE-TIME`) Replication Key column for initial and ongoing replication jobs.

      Let's assume the Replication Key column for the table in this example is a column named `updated_at`.
    columns:
      - name: "id"
      - name: "updated_at"
        replication-key: true
      - name: "active"
    examples:
      - job: "initial"
        source: |
          A table in the source contains three records: `1`, `2`, `3`. Every time a record is created or modified, its `updated_at` value is updated.

        extracted: |
          Depending on the integration type, the initial extraction for a table using {{ replication-method.display-name | append: " Replication" }} will vary slightly:

          - For a **database integration**:
             1. Stitch replicates the entire table in full.
             2. Stitch saves `updated_at: 2018-07-27 12:07:00` as the maximum Replication Key value.

          - For a **SaaS integration**:
             1. Stitch uses the **Start Date** defined in the {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} as the initial Replication Key (`updated_at`) value.
             2. Records with an `updated_at` value greater than or equal to the **Start Date** are replicated.
             3. Stitch saves `updated_at: 2018-07-27 12:07:00` as the maximum Replication Key value.

        tables:
          - location: "source"
            records: &key-timestamp-initial-source-table
              - id: "1"
                updated_at: "2018-07-27 12:00:00"
                active: "false"

              - id: "2"
                updated_at: "2018-07-27 12:05:00"
                active: "false"

              - id: "3"
                updated_at: "2018-07-27 12:07:00"
                active: "false"

          - location: "extracted"
            records: *key-timestamp-initial-source-table

      - job: "second"
        source: |
          Before the next replication job, record `2` is updated and a new record, `4`, is added to the table in the source. The `updated_at` values for these records are updated.
          
        extracted: |
          Stitch replicates records `3`, `2`, and `4`, as the records' `updated_at` values are either **greater than or equal to** the last saved maximum Replication Key value of `updated_at: 2018-07-27 12:07:00` from the previous replication job.

          Record `3` is selected because its `updated_at` value is equal to the maximum Replication Key value from the previous replication job.

          If this were a SQL query, it would look like this:

          ```sql
          SELECT *
            FROM sample_table
           WHERE updated_at >= '2018-07-27 12:07:00'
          ```
        tables:
          - location: "source"
            records:
              - id: "1"
                updated_at: "2018-07-27 12:00:00"
                active: "false"

              - id: "2"
                updated_at: "2018-07-28 09:12:00"
                active: "true"

              - id: "3"
                updated_at: "2018-07-27 12:07:00"
                active: "false"

              - id: "4"
                updated_at: "2018-07-28 06:53:00"
                active: "false"

          - location: "extracted"
            records:
              - id: "2"
                updated_at: "2018-07-28 09:12:00"
                active: "true"

              - id: "3"
                updated_at: "2018-07-27 12:07:00"
                active: "false"

              - id: "4"
                updated_at: "2018-07-28 06:53:00"
                active: "false"

  - id: "integer-rep-key"
    type: "Integer Replication Key"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll demonstrate how {{ replication-method.display-name | append: " Replication" }} works with an auto-incrementing `INTEGER` Replication Key column.

      For this table, the Replication Key is a column named `customer_id`. The value of this column increments every time a new record is added to the table, but it is never updated after the record is created.

    columns:
      - name: "customer_id"
        replication-key: true
      - name: "name"
      - name: "active"
    examples:
      - job: "initial"
        source: |
          A table in the source contains three records: `1`, `2`, `3`.

          The `customer_id` value is auto-incremented when a new record is added to the table. This column is not updated, even if changes are made to the record.

        extracted: |

          1. Stitch replicates the entire table in full.
          2. Stitch saves `customer_id: 3` as the maximum Replication Key value.

        tables:
          - location: "source"
            records: &key-integer-initial-source-table
              - customer_id: "1"
                name: "Finn"
                active: "false"

              - customer_id: "2"
                name: "Jake"
                active: "false"

              - customer_id: "3"
                name: "Bubblegum"
                active: "false"

          - location: "extracted"
            records: *key-integer-initial-source-table

      - job: "second"
        source: |
          Before the next replication job, record `2` is updated and a new record, `4`, is added to the table in the source.
          
        extracted: |
          
          1. Stitch replicates records `3` and `4`, as the records' `customer_id` values are either **greater than or equal to** the last saved maximum Replication Key value of `customer_id: 3` from the previous replication job. Note that:
             - Record `3` is selected because its `customer_id` value is equal to the maximum Replication Key value from the previous replication job.
             - Record `2` is not selected because its `customer_id` value wasn't updated when the record was modified, and was therefore less than the last saved maximum Replication Key value.
          2. Stitch saves `customer_id: 4` as the new maximum Replication Key value.

          If this were a SQL query, it would look like this:

          ```sql
          SELECT *
            FROM sample_table
           WHERE customer_id >= 3
          ```
        tables:
          - location: "source"
            records:
              - customer_id: "1"
                name: "Finn"
                active: "false"

              - customer_id: "2"
                name: "Jake"
                active: "true"

              - customer_id: "3"
                name: "Bubblegum"
                active: "false"

              - customer_id: "4"
                name: "Beamo"
                active: "false"

          - location: "extracted"
            records:
              - customer_id: "3"
                name: "Bubblegum"
                active: "false"

              - customer_id: "4"
                name: "Beamo"
                active: "false"
