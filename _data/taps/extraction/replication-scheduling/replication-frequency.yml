examples:
  - name: "six-hour"

      In this example, we'll look at the potential schedule for an integration with a Replication Frequency of **{{ schedule-example.replication-frequency }}**.

  - name: "long-running-skipped-job"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll look at how a job can be skipped due to a previously long-running job. This can occur when a job takes longer to run than the selected Replication Frequency.
