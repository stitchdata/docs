      In this example, we'll look at the potential schedule for an integration with an Anchor Time set to shortly after the current time:
    current-date-time: "May 1 @ 8:00 AM (EST), or UTC 12:00"
    replication-frequency: "6 hours"
    anchor-time: "9:00 AM (EST), or UTC 13:00"
    schedule-summary: "every 6 hours starting on May 1 at 9:00 AM (EST)"
    jobs:
      - number: 1
        start-est: "May 1 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 1 13:00:00"
      - number: 2
        start-est: "May 1 15:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 1 19:00:00"
      - number: 3
        start-est: "May 1 21:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 2 01:00:00"
      - number: 4
        start-est: "May 2 03:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 2 07:00:00"
      - number: 5
        start-est: "May 2 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 2 13:00:00"

  - name: "twenty-four-hour"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll look at potential schedule for an integration with an Anchor Time that has already passed for the current day:
    current-date-time: "May 1 @ 12:00 PM (EST), or UTC 16:00"
    replication-frequency: "24 hours"
    anchor-time: "9:00 AM (EST), or UTC 13:00"
    schedule-summary: "every 24 hours starting the following day (May 2) at 9:00 AM (EST)"
    jobs:
      - number: 1
        start-est: "May 2 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 2 13:00:00"
      - number: 2
        start-est: "May 3 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 3 13:00:00"
      - number: 3
        start-est: "May 4 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 4 13:00:00"
      - number: 4
        start-est: "May 5 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 5 13:00:00"
      - number: 5
        start-est: "May 6 09:00:00"
        start-utc: "May 6 13:00:00"

  - name: "long-running-skipped-job"
    description: |
      In this example, we'll look at how a job can be skipped and re-scheduled due to a previously long-running job. This can occur when a job takes longer to run than the selected Replication Frequency.
    current-date-time: "May 1 @ 1:30 PM (EST), or UTC 17:30"
    replication-frequency: "1 hour"
    anchor-time: "2:30 PM (EST), or UTC 18:30"
    schedule-summary: "every hour starting on May 1 at 2:30 PM (EST)"
    jobs:
      - number: 1
        start-est: "May 1 02:30:00"
        start-utc: "May 1 18:30:00"
        end-est: "May 1 03:25:00"
      - number: 2
        start-est: "May 1 03:30:00"
        start-utc: "May 1 19:30:00"
        end-est: "May 1 04:38:00"
      - number: 3
        start-est: "Job"
        start-utc: "is"
        end-est: "skipped"
      - number: 4
        start-est: "May 1 05:30:00"
        start-utc: "May 1 21:30:00"
        end-est: "May 1 06:21:00"
      - number: 5
        start-est: "May 1 06:30:00"
        start-utc: "May 1 22:30:00"
