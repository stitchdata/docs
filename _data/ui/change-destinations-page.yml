    Stitch will pick up where it left off and only replicate **new** data to your new destination.
  historical-data-copy: &historical-data-copy |
    Stitch will clear all Replication Key values, queue a **full re-replication** of your integrations' data, and replicate all historical data to your new destination. For SaaS integrations, Stitch will replicate data beginning with the **Start Date** currently listed in the integration's settings.

          **Note**: This isn't applicable to webhook integrations. Historical data for webhooks must be replayed or manually backfilled after the switch is complete.

      Select this option if you manually transferred your historical data or you don't need to re-replicate historical data. Stitch will pick up where it left off and only replicate **new** data to the new {{ destination.display_name }} destination.
