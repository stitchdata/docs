# -------------------------- #
#     Special characters     #
# -------------------------- #

special-characters:
  - character: "*"
    name: "asterisk"
    allowed-in: &all "All fields"
    description: |
      Selects all values within a field.

# **Note**: If used, an asterisk can be the only value in the field. For example: `*,30` would result in an error.
    example: |
      - `*` in the **Minute** field means _"every minute"_
      - `*` in the **Hour** field means _"every hour"_
      - `*` in the **Month** field means _"every month"_
      - `*` in the **Day of week** field means _"every day of the week"_

  - character: ","
    name: "comma"
    allowed-in: *all
    description: |
      Specifies a list of two or more values.
    example: |
      - `1,2,5` or `JAN,FEB,MAY` in the **Month** field means _"the months January, February, and May"_
      - `2,6` or `MON,FRI` in the **Day of week** field means _"the days Monday and Friday"_

  - character: "-"
    name: "hyphen"
    allowed-in: *all
    description: |
      Specifies a range of values.
    example: |
      - `5-8` in the **Hour** field means _"the hours 5, 6, 7, and 8"_
      - `2-4` or `MON-WED` in the **Day of week** field means _"the days Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday"_

  - character: "?"
    name: "question mark"
    allowed-in: "Day of month, Day of week"
    description: |
      Indicates _"no specific value"_. This character is useful when you need to specify something in either the **Day of month** or **Day of week** field, but not the other.

      **Note**: Quartz doesn't currently support specifying a value for both the **Day of week** and **Day of month** fields. This value must be present in one of these fields for the expression to be valid.
    example: |
      - [TODO]

  - character: "/"
    name: "slash"
    allowed-in: *all
    description: |
      Specifies increments. Formatted as: `<value>/<value_to_increment`>
    example: |
      - `0/15` in the **Minute** field means _"the minutes 0, 15, 30, and 45"_
      - `3/6` in the **Hour** field means _"every 6 hours beginning on the third hour"_
      - `1/5` in the **Day of month** field means _"every 5 days beginning on the first day of the month"_

  - character: "L"
    name: "last"
    allowed-in: "Day of month, Day of week"
    description: |
      Depending on the field `L` is used in, this can have different meanings:

      - **Day of month**: Used to indicate the last day of the month.
      - **Day of week**: If used by itself, this means `7`, or `SAT`.
         
         If used after another value in this field (for example: `6L`), this means _"the last [xxx] day of the month"_.

      To avoid confusing or unexpected results, don't specify lists or ranges of values with `L`.
    example: |
      - `L` in the **Day of month** field means _"the last day of the month"_, such as January 31 or February 28 (or 29 during a leap year)
      - `6L` or `FRIL` in the **Day of week** field means _"the last Friday of the month"_

  - character: "W"
    name: "weekday"
    allowed-in: "Day of month"
    description: |
      Specifies the weekday (Monday - Friday) closest to the given day. **Note**: This character is only allowed when the **Day of month** value is a single day, not a range or list of days.

      `L` can also be combined with `W` in the **Day of month** field to indicate _"the last weekday of the month"_.
    example: |
      - `15W` means _"the nearest weekday to the 15th of the month"_. If the 15th were a Saturday, a replication job would begin on Friday the 14th.
      - `1W` means _"the nearest weekday to the 1st of the month"_. If the 1st is a Saturday, the replication job would begin on Monday the 3rd. Advanced scheduling can't skip over a boundary of days.
      - `LW` means _"the last weekday of the month"_

  - character: "#"
    name: "hash"
    allowed-in: "Day of week"
    description: |
      Specifies the `nth` day of the month, such as _"the third Friday of the month"_. This is used with a day of week value (`1-7` or `SUN-SAT`) and an integer of `1-5`, formatted as `<day_of_week_value>#<integer>`.

      **Note**: If `<day_of_week_value>#5` is specified and there isn't a fifth given day of week in the month, then the replication job will not be triggered.
    example: |
      - `4#2` or `WED#2` means _"the second Wednesday of the month"_
      - `2#1` or `MON#1` means _"the first Monday of the month"_
      - `7#5` or `SAT#5` means _"the fifth Saturday of the month"_. If a month doesn't have five Saturdays, a replication job will not be triggered.
