#   DEFAULT DB INTEGRATION SETTINGS FIELDS   #
# ------------------------------------------ #

## This file contains the default field names and descriptions for
## the fields in the Database Integrations Settings page for database integrations.

## As the required fields vary from integration to integration, 
## each integration type lists the fields required for its
## specific setup and, if applicable, a integration that's specific
## to that integration.

## See the other files in this folder (_data/ui/database-integration-settings)
## for the specifics of each database type.


# -------------------------- #
#     Default Field Names    #
# -------------------------- #
## Defines the default field names in the Database Integration Settings page.

field-names:
  integration-name: "Integration Name"
  host: "Host (Endpoint)"
  port: "Port"
  username: "Username"
  password: "Password"
  database: "Database"

  encryption: "Encryption Type"

## These fields are used when the instructions are for connecting
## a database using an SSH tunnel or SSL.

  ssh-host: &ssh-host "SSH Host"
  ssh-user: &ssh-user "SSH User"
  ssh-port: &ssh-port "SSH Port"

  ssl: "Connect using SSL"


# -------------------------- #
#        Default Copy        #
# -------------------------- #

## Default copy for fields. Used when the user doesn't require any 
## additional or info specific to the integration to complete the setup.

field-copy:
  integration-name: |
    Enter a name for the integration. This is the name that will display on the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} for the integration; it’ll also be used to create the schema in your data warehouse.

            For example, the name “Stitch {{ integration.display_name }}” would create a schema called `stitch_{{ integration.name | replace:"-","_" }}` in the data warehouse. **Note:** The schema name cannot be changed after the integration is saved.

  host: |
    Enter the host address (endpoint) used by the {{ integration.display_name }} instance.

            In general, this will be `127.0.0.1` (localhost), but could also be some other network address (ex: `192.68.0.1`) or your server's public IP address. **Note:** This must be the actual address - entering `localhost` into this field will cause connection issues.
  port: |
    Enter the port used by the {{ integration.display_name }} instance. The default is `{{ integration.port }}`.
  
  username: "Enter the Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} database user's username."

  password: |
    Enter the password for the Stitch {{ destination.display_name }} database user.
  
  database: |
    Enter the name of the {{ integration.display_name }} database you want to connect to Stitch. Stitch will 'find' all databases you give the Stitch user access to - a default database is only used to complete the connection. This is required for {{ integration.display_name }} integrations.

  optional-database: |
      **Optional:** Enter the name of the default database Stitch will connect to. Stitch will 'find' all databases you give the Stitch user access to - a default database is only used to test and complete the connection.

  ssl: |
    **Note:** The database must support and allow SSL connections for this setting to work correctly.

  ssh-host: &ssh-host-copy "Enter the IP address or hostname of the server Stitch will SSH into."

  ssh-user: &ssh-user-copy "Enter the Stitch Linux (SSH) user's username."

  ssh-port: &ssh-port-copy "Enter the SSH port on your sever. (`22` by default)"
