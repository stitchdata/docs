#   DEFAULT DB INTEGRATION SETTINGS FIELDS   #
# ------------------------------------------ #

## This file contains the default field names and descriptions for
## the fields in the Database Integrations Settings page for database integrations.

## As the required fields vary from integration to integration, 
## each integration type lists the fields required for its
## specific setup and, if applicable, a integration that's specific
## to that integration.

## See the other files in this folder (_data/ui/database-integration-settings)
## for the specifics of each database type.


# -------------------------- #
#     Default Field Names    #
# -------------------------- #
## Defines the default field names in the Database Integration Settings page.

field-names:
  integration-name: "Integration Name"
  host: "Host (Endpoint)"
  port: "Port"
  username: "Username"
  password: "Password"
  database: "Database"

  encryption: "Encryption Type"

## These fields are used when the instructions are for connecting
## a database using an SSH tunnel or SSL.

  ssh-host: &ssh-host "SSH Host"
  ssh-user: &ssh-user "SSH User"
  ssh-port: &ssh-port "SSH Port"

  ssl: "Connect using SSL"


# -------------------------- #
#        Default Copy        #
# -------------------------- #

## Default copy for fields. Used when the user doesn't require any 
## additional or info specific to the integration to complete the setup.

field-copy:
  integration-name: |
    Enter a name for the integration. This is the name that will display on the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} for the integration; it’ll also be used to create the schema in your destination.

            For example, the name “Stitch {{ integration.display_name }}” would create a schema called `stitch_{{ integration.display_name | slugify | replace:"-","_" }}` in the destination. **Note:** The schema name cannot be changed after the integration is saved.

  host: |
    Enter the host address (endpoint) used by the {{ page.display_name }} instance. For example: This could be a network address such as `192.68.0.1`, or a server endpoint like `dbname.hosting-provider.com`.

  host-rds: |
    Paste the **Endpoint** address from the {{ page.display_name }} Details page in AWS into this field. Don’t include the port number, if it's appended to the end of the endpoint string - this will cause errors.

  host-cloudsql: |
    Enter the host address (endpoint) of your {{ page.display_name }} instance. This will be the value of the **Public IP address** that you retrieved in [STEP].

  port: |
    Enter the port used by the {{ page.display-name }} instance. The default is `{{ page.port }}`.
  
  username: "Enter the Stitch {{ page.display_name }} database user's username."

  password: |
    Enter the password for the Stitch {{ page.display_name }} database user.
  
  database: |
    Enter the name of the {{ page.display_name }} database you want to connect to Stitch. Stitch will 'find' all databases you give the Stitch user access to - a default database is only used to complete the connection. This is required for {{ page.display_name }} integrations.

  optional-database: |
      **Optional:** Enter the name of the default database Stitch will connect to. Stitch will 'find' all databases you give the Stitch user access to - a default database is only used to test and complete the connection.

  schema-names-tables: |
    {% if integration.db-type == "mongo" %}
    {% assign table = "collection" %}
    {% else %}
    {% assign table = "table" %}
    {% endif %}
    Checking this setting will include schema names from the source database in the destination table name - for example: `<source_schema_name>__<{{table}}_name>`.

          Stitch loads all selected replicated tables to a single schema, preserving only the {{table}} name. If two {{table}}s canonicalize to the same name - even if they're in different source databases or schemas - name collision errors can arise. Checking this setting can prevent these issues. 

          **Note**: This setting can not be changed after the integration is saved. Additionally, this setting may create table names that exceed your destination's limits. For more info, refer to the [Database Integration Table Name Collisions guide]({{ link.troubleshooting.database-table-name-collisions | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

  ssl: |
    **Note:** The database must support and allow SSL connections for this setting to work correctly.

  ssh-host: &ssh-host-copy |
    {% case page.hosting-type %}

    {% when 'amazon' %}
    Paste the **Public DNS** of the SSH sever (EC2 instance) into this field. Refer to the [Amazon SSH guide]({{ link.security.ssh-amazon | prepend: site.baseurl }}#retrieve-ssh-connection-details) for instructions on retrieving this info.

    {% when 'microsoft' %}
    Paste the **Public IP address** of the SSH server (virtual machine) into this field. Refer to the [Microsoft Azure SSH guide]({{ link.security.ssh-microsoft-azure | prepend: site.baseurl }}#retrieve-vm-connection-details) for instructions on retrieving this info.

    {% else %}
    Enter the public IP address or hostname of the server Stitch will SSH into.
    {% endcase %}

  ssh-user: &ssh-user-copy "Enter the Stitch Linux (SSH) user's username."

  ssh-port: &ssh-port-copy |
    {% case page.hosting-type %}
    {% when 'amazon' %}
    Enter the SSH port of the SSH server (EC2 instance) into this field. This will usually be `22`.

    {% when 'microsoft' %}
    Enter the SSH port of the SSH server (virtual machine) into this field. This will usually be `22`.

    {% else %}
    Enter the SSH port on your server. (`22` by default)
    {% endcase %}
