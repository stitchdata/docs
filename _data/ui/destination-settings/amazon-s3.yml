# -------------------------- #

## This file contains the properties required to successfully set up
## an Amazon S3 destination in Stitch.

amazon-s3:
  - name: "Bucket Name"
    copy: "Enter the name of bucket. Enter only the bucket name: No URLs, `https`, or S3 parts. For example: `com-test-stitch-bucket`"

  - name: "Store Data in This Format"
    copy: |
      The data storage format defines the type of file Stitch will write to your {{ destination.display_name }} bucket. For examples of how data in each format will be stored, [click here]({{ link.destinations.overviews.amazon-s3 | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#data-storage-formats" }}).

            Supported options are:

            - **JSON**: Data will be stored as JSON files (`.jsonl`)
            - **CSV**: Data will be stored as CSV files (`.csv`). If selected, additional configuration options will be displayed.

  - name: "Delimiter"
    copy: |
      **Applicable only if the data storage format is `csv`.** Select the delimiter you want to use. Stitch will use the **comma** (`,`) option by default, but you may also use **pipes** (`|`) and **tabs** (`\t`).

  - name: "Quote all elements in key-value pairs"
    copy: |
      **Applicable only if the data storage format is `csv`.** If selected, Stitch will place all elements of key-value pairs in quotes. For example: Numerical fields will appear as `"123"` instead of `123`.
