#     COMMON DESTINATION SETTINGS FIELDS     #
# ------------------------------------------ #

## This file contains the default field names and descriptions for
## the fields in the Destination Settings page for destinations.

## As the required fields vary from destination to destination, 
## each destination type lists the fields required for its
## specific setup and, if applicable, a destination that's specific
## to that destination.

## See the other files in this folder (_data/ui/destination-settings)
## for the specifics of each database type.

field-copy:
  destination-database: |
    Enter the name of the {{ page.display_name }} database you want to connect to Stitch.

  ssl-certificate: &ssl-certificate-copy |
    **Optional**: Provide the certificate (typically a CA or server certificate) Stitch should verify the SSL connection against. The connection will succeed only if the server's certificate verifies against the certificate provided here.

            **Note**: Providing a certificate isn't required to use SSL. This is only if Stitch should verify the connection against a specific certificate.
