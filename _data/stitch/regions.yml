#  Stitch Supported Regions  #
# -------------------------- #

## The regions Stitch supports
## This link is for AWS VPC docs, but we'll use the appropriate
## region for whatever service is required at the time:
## EX: EKS, VPC, EC2, etc:
## https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/vpc-service.html

## NOTE: IP addresses vary between regions. Each region has its own
## section with its IPs on the Stitch IP addresses guide.
## The anchor to each section follows this convention:
## {{ region.id }}-ip-addresses
