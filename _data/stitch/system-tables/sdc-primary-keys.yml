  Applicable only to Google BigQuery (v2) and Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations, the `{{ site.data.stitch.system-tables.sdc-primary-keys.name }}` table contains a list of the tables in an integration schema and the columns those tables use as Primary Keys. Every integration schema created by Stitch will contain this table.

attributes:
  - name: &table-name "table_name"
    type: "string"
    description: "The name of the table in the integration schema."
    data: |
      emails

  - name: &column-name "column_name"
    type: "string"
    description: |
      The name of the column used as the table's Primary Key. If a table uses multiple columns as a composite Primary Key, there will be a row for each column the table uses.
    data: |
      email_id

  - name: &ordinal-position "ordinal_position"
    type: "integer"

      **Note**: This column is only applicable to Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations.

      When Stitch receives data, Primary Keys are provided in an array. For example: `["email_id", "created_at", "customer_id"]`

      The value of this column corresponds to the index of the column in the array Stitch receives.
