# This is the schema for the Primary Keys table
# for Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations.

name: "_sdc_primary_keys"
description: |
  Applicable only to Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations, the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table contains a list of the tables in an integration schema and the columns those tables use as Primary Keys. Every integration schema created by Stitch will contain this table.

attributes:
  - name: &table-name "table_name"
    description: "The name of the table in the integation schema."
    data: |
      emails

  - name: &column-name "column_name"
    description: |
      The name of the column used as the table's Primary Key. If a table uses multiple columns as a composite Primary Key, there will be a row for each column the table uses.
    data: |
      email_id

  - name: &ordinal-position "ordinal_position"
    description: |
      When Stitch receives data, Primary Keys are provided in an array. For example: `["email_id", "created_at", "customer_id"]`

      The value of this column corresponds to the index of the column in the array Stitch receives.

  For every column a table uses as a Primary Key, the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table will contain a row containing the table's name, the name of the column, and the column's position in the Primary Key array Stitch receives.

  For example: If Stitch received the array `["email_id", "updated_at", "customer_id"]` for an `emails` table, the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table would contain the following records:

example-records:
  - table-name: "emails"
    column-name: "email_id"
    ordinal-position: "0"

  - table-name: "emails"
    column-name: "updated_at"
    ordinal-position: "1"
  
  - table-name: "emails"
    column-name: "customer_id"
    ordinal-position: "2"
