categories:
  - name: "all"
    display-name: "All tables/integrations"
    description: |
      These columns are applicable to all tables and integration types. Unless noted, every column in this list will be present in every integration table created by Stitch.

  - name: "subtables"
    display-name: "Subtables"
    description: |
      These columns are applicable to integration subtables created by Stitch. Subtables are created when Stitch loads nested data into a destination that doesn't support nested data structures. Refer to the [Nested JSON Data Structures and Row Count Impact]({{ link.destinations.storage.nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide for more info and examples.

  - name: "databases"
    display-name: "Database integrations"
    description: |
      These columns are applicable only to database integrations.

  - name: "saas"
    display-name: "SaaS integrations"
    description: |
      These columns are applicable only to SaaS integrations.

#------------------------------------#
#       CURRENT SYSTEM COLUMNS       #
#------------------------------------#

# As part of the replication process, Stitch injects a few system
# columns into every table it creates in a destination.

# Below is a mapping of the current system columns and their descriptions.

# Should a system column name or function change, this is the section that must be updated.

current-columns:
  prefix: "_sdc"
  rjm-prefix: "_rjm"

# DELETED_AT
  deleted-at: &deleted-at "_sdc_deleted_at"
  deleted-at-description: &deleted-at-description |
    **Applicable only to database integrations that support Log-based Replication.** Timestamp indicating when Stitch detected a `DELETE` event for the record while reading from the database's binary log. Otherwise, this field will be null.

    Additionally, this column will not populate until after the initial historical replication job has been completed. Stitch can only detect delete row events while reading from binary logs, which are not used during initial replication jobs.

    **Note**: Only certain event types are supported for Log-based Replication. Refer to the [Deleted record handling]({{ link.replication.deleted-records | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide for more info.

# EXTRACTED_AT
  extracted-at: &extracted-at "_sdc_extracted_at"
  extracted-at-description: &extracted-at-description |
    Timestamp indicating when Stitch extracted the record from the source.

# RECEIVED_AT
  received-at: &received-at "_sdc_received_at"
  received-at-description: &received-at-description |
    Timestamp indicating when Stitch received the record for loading.

# BATCHED_AT
  batched-at: &batched-at "_sdc_batched_at"
  batched-at-description: &batched-at-description |
    Timestamp indicating when Stitch loaded the batch the record was a part of into the data warehouse.

# SEQUENCE
  sequence: &sequence "_sdc_sequence"
  sequence-description: &sequence-description |
    A Unix epoch (in milliseconds) that indicates the order in which data points were considered for loading.

# TABLE_VERSION
  table-version: &table-version "_sdc_table_version"
  table-version-description: &table-version-description |
    Indicates the version of the table. This column is used to complete a switch-view operation, when necessary.

# SOURCE KEY
  source-key: &source-key "_sdc_source_key_"
  source-key-description: &source-key-description |
    **Applicable only to subtables**, this column forms part of a composite Primary Key for the table. It contains the top level table's Primary Key and will also inherit the Primary Key's data type.

    For example: there is a top-level table (`orders`) with a Primary Key of `order_id` (`INTEGER`). If a subtable were created from `orders`, this column would be named `{{ system-column.source-key | append:"order_id" }}`, be typed as an `INTEGER`, and contain the same values.

# LEVEL ID
  level-id: &level-id "_sdc_level_#_id"
  level-id-description: &level-id-description |
    **Applicable only to subtables**, this column forms part of a composite Primary Key for the table and can be used to associate further nested records to the parent.

    Values in this column will auto-increment for each unique record in the table, beginning with 0. When used with the `{{ system-column.primary-key }}` column(s), a unique identifier for the row is created.

    Depending on the level of nesting, there may be multiple `{{ system-column.level-id | remove: "_#" }}` columns in a subtable.

# PRIMARY_KEY
  primary-key: &primary-key "_sdc_primary_key"
  primary-key-description: &primary-key-description |
    **Applicable only if Stitch doesn't detect a Primary Key in the source table.** Stitch will use this column to de-dupe data.

# REPLICATION_ID
  replication-id: &replication-id "_sdc_replication_id"
  replication-id-description: &replication-id-description |
    **Applicable only to database integrations**, this column contains an auto-generated ID that Stitch injects when a Primary Key isn't detected. Stitch will use this column to de-dupe data.

# CUSTOMER ID
  customer-id: &customer-id "_sdc_customer_id"
  customer-id-description: &customer-id-description |
    **Applicable only to Google AdWords integrations,** this column contains the AdWords Account ID the data in the row pertains to.

    For example: the `ad_performance_report` table may contain data from several AdWords accounts. The value in the `_sdc_customer_id` column allows you to associate records with the correct AdWords account.

# REPORT DATE TIME
  report-date-time: &report-date-time "_sdc_report_datetime"
  report-date-time-description: &report-date-time-description |
    **Applicable only to Google AdWords and DoubleClick Campaign Manager inetgrations,** this column indicates the starting time of the Stitch job that extracted the relevant row's data.
