## Verify Your Full Name is in Stitch

By design, Stitch is supposed to prevent accounts that don't contain a last name from being created. On occasion, however, one will slip through.

If you're having trouble getting Stitch to process your payment, it may be because **only your first name is entered on your User profile.** You can verify this in the **{{ app.page-names.user-profile }}** page.

1. Click {{ app.menu-paths.account-settings }}.
2. Click **{{ app.page-names.user-profile }}**.
3. If your last name is missing from the **Full Name** field, enter it.
4. Click {{ app.buttons.update-profile }}.

After you've added your last name, try entering your payment method into the **{{ app.page-names.billing }}** page again. Note that it may take a few moments for the changes to take affect, so don't worry if you see an error immediately after saving.
