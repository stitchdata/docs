Having trouble logging into your Stitch account? To troubleshoot account lockout, we recommend the steps below before reaching out to support.

---

## Verify your email address {#verify-email-address}

Double-check your email address to be certain the email address you are attempting to use to log in is associated with an existing Stitch account.

---

## Reset your password

You can use the **Forgot?** link on the login page to reset your password. 

If you don't see an email from us after a short period of time - say 15 minutes - check your spam folder. Sometimes even well-intentioned emails can be mistaken for junk.

{% include important.html type="single-line" content ="The password reset links in these emails are only good for one attempt. If you click the link more than once, the link will expire and you'll have to request another password reset. Requesting multiple resets in a single day can result in account lockout." %}

---

## Clear your cache and pause ad blockers {#clear-cache-ad-blockers}

If you're still locked out, certain that your email address is correct, and you're using the correct link from the reset email, we recommend trying the following before you request another reset and attempt to login again:

- Clear your browser's cache, cookies, and saved passwords
- Temporarily turn off any ad-blocking software

**Requesting multiple password resets in a single day can result in account lockout.** Rather than repeatedly requesting resets, please move onto the next troubleshooting step and contact our support team.

## Document console errors {#document-errors}

**Note**: This step isn’t always required, but proactively completing it could reduce the time spent on researching the root cause.

If you’re still unable to access your account, we recommend checking for errors and reaching out to our support team.

You can do this by opening your browser’s developer tools and taking a screenshot of any errors displayed in the the console, or site log window. You can typically **right click and select Inspect** to open the console. If your browser doesn’t have this method or you need help, use the documentation links below for the web browser you’re using:

- [Safari](http://www.technipages.com/mac-os-x-enable-web-inspector-in-safari)
- [Firefox](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Tools/Web_Console/Opening_the_Web_Console)
- [Chrome](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/chrome-devtools/?hl=en)
- [Opera](http://www.opera.com/dragonfly/documentation/)
- [Internet Explorer](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/gg589512(v=vs.85).aspx#OpeningTools)

In some browsers, opening the developer tools might not automatically display the console - the site’s code may display first. If this happens to you, click the **Console** option in the developer window and take screenshots of any errors displayed there.

Please reach out to our support team with the **error screenshots** and the **email address** associated with your account.
