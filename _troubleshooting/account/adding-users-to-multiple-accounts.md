**Note that currently a single email address can only be associated with one Stitch account.**

A few of our customers have two Stitch accounts: one for staging and one for production usage. If you want the same email address to be used for both accounts, you can use the '`+`' feature if your email provider supports it.

If this email address is used to create the first Stitch account, which is used for staging: `stitch@stitchdata.com`

You canuse '`+`' to add this team member to the second Stitch account, which is used for production: `stitch+prod@stitchdata.com`
