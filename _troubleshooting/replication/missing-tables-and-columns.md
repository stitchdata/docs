> Stitch cannot detect any objects (databases, tables, etc.) at or below this level.

If you receive this message or you can't find an object (database, table, column, etc.), it's typically a **permissions** issue.

---

## Database Integrations
Verify that the Stitch user has all the required permissions as outlined in the **Setup** instructions for the database. Docs for database integrations [can be found here]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases).

---

## SaaS Integrations

Some SaaS integrations - like [Salesforce]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/salesforce) and [Facebook Ads]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/facebook-ads) - allow specific permissions to be granted to users. **Stitch will only be able to detect and replicate the objects that the user who authorized (created) the integration in Stitch can access.**

Verify the authorizing user's permissions. If the user's permissions can't be changed, a different person with the correct permissions may have to re-authorize the integration. Docs for SaaS integrations [can be found here]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas).

## Contacting Support

If you verify that all the correct permissions are in place and you still encounter issues, please [reach out to support]({{ site.support }}).
