intro: |
  When Stitch replicates data from an Microsoft SQL Server-backed database, it will check for the required user permissions and database server settings. If permissions or server settings aren't properly defined, you may receive an error during the Extraction phase of the replication process. These errors will surface in the integration's [Extraction Logs]({{ link.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

sections:
  - title: "Microsoft SQL Server-backed databases"
    anchor: "microsoft-sql-server-backed-databases"
    content: |
      {% assign all-databases = site.database-integrations | where:"input",true %}
      {% assign mssql-databases = all-databases | where:"db-type","mssql" %}

      The errors and troubleshooting steps in this article are applicable to the following database integrations:

      {% for database in mssql-databases %}
      - [{{ database.title }}]({{ database.url | prepend: site.baseurl }})
      {% endfor %}

  - title: "Extraction errors and troubleshooting"
    anchor: "extraction-errors-and-troubleshooting"
    content: |
      {% assign errors = site.data.errors.extraction.databases.mssql.all %}

      Below are the errors you might see if Stitch has trouble replicating data from an Microsoft SQL Server-backed database, as well as how to resolve them.
