## Invalid Panoply Credentials

If you’ve recently reset your password in Panoply, you’ll also need to update it in Stitch. Try entering your new password in the **{{ app.page-names.dw-settings }}** page to see if this resolves any invalid credentials / connection failure errors.

1. On the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} page, click the {{ app.menu-paths.destination-settings }}.
2. Click the **Set a New Password** link under the **Password** field.
3. Enter your new Panoply password.
4. Click the {{ app.buttons.update-dw-settings | flatify }} button.
