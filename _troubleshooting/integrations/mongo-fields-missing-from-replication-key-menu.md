There are also some other considerations around Mongo Replication Keys, which you can read about in the [Selecting & Changing Mongo Replication Keys guide]({{ link.replication.mongo-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

## Detect Fields for Use as Replication Keys {#detecting-mongo-fields}

Stitch uses the `listIndexes` command to find fields that you can use for Incremental Replication. This means:

- If the Stitch user doesn't have permissions to run this command on a specified collection OR
- The field you want to use isn't indexed

Stitch will only be able to display the `_id` field in the Replication Key selection field.

**If the collection is append-only**, this may be perfectly fine.

**If the collection isn't append-only**, another field may be needed. We recommend reviewing the [Selecting & Changing Mongo Replication Keys guide]({{ link.replication.mongo-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for help selecting an appropriate Replication Key.

## Next Steps

1. Verify that the Stitch Mongo user has all the required permissions as outlined in the [Mongo connection instructions]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases/mongodb).
2. Verify that the field you want to use is indexed.
3. Verify that the field you want to use as a Replication Key exists in the root of the document.

**Note that it may take some time for Stitch to detect and process these changes after you've applied them.** We recommend waiting for a replication cycle to complete before reaching out to support.

## Contact Support

If you've done all of the above, a full replication cycle has completed, and the field still hasn't shown up in the Replication Key field, please reach out to support.
