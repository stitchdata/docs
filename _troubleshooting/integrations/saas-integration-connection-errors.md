## Verify Integration Whitelist Settings

Some SaaS integrations offer an IP restriction feature that restricts access only to the IP addresses that are whitelisted, or given access.

If you're having connection issues with one of the following SaaS integrations, IP restriction may be enabled. If this is the case, you'll need to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses to ensure the connection is successful.

**Click the links below to view instructions specific to that integration**.

## Check for Reported Issues

If the troubleshooting steps detailed above donâ€™t resolve the issue or if the errors persist, we recommend checking for reported issues:

1. **On the SaaS integration provider's Status Page**. All the SaaS integrations that have Status Pages can be found here: [Third-Party Downtime]({{ link.troubleshooting.third-party-downtime | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
2. **On Stitch's Status Page**, which can be found here: [Stitch Status Page]({{ site.status }}).
