  Stitch gives you the ability to consolidate and optimize your data, but if you want to do some exploring, you'll need an additional visualization or middle ware tool. 

  Whether you want to create visual analyses or run SQL queries, Stitch is compatible with a broad range of tools - from business intelligence platforms to SQL editors to data science tools.

sections:
  - title: "Analytics tools"
    anchor: "analytics-tools"
    content: |
      We've partnered with some of the best-in-class tools for business intelligence and visualization. These tools will enable you to take a deep-dive into your data and visualize the results.

      As a bonus, some tools - like Mode - also include a built-in SQL querying tool.

      <ul class="tiles">
      {% assign analytics = page.analytics | sort:"name" %}
      {% for tool in analytics %}
          <li>
              <a href="{{ tool.url }}" target="new">
                  <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/analysis-tools/{{ tool.id }}.svg" alt="{{ tool.name }}">
              </a>
              <strong>{{ tool.name }}</strong><br>
              {{ tool.price }}
          </li>
      {% endfor %}
      </ul>

  - title: "SQL editors"
    anchor: "sql-editors"
    content: |
      If you want to directly query your data, you'll need a SQL editor to connect to your data warehouse.

      In addition to allowing you to use SQL to analyze your data, a SQL editor is an incredibly valuable asset when diagnosing a data discrepancy. As we'll ask you to submit the results of several SQL queries to us to help troubleshoot the discrepancy, we recommend finding one you like. We happen to like Postico here at Stitch.

    anchor: "data-science"
    content: |
      Want to use your data for something other than creating charts or queries? From machine learning to statistical modeling, this list of data science clients will get you started.
