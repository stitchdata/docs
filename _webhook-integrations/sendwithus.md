#### Existing Email Service Providers

1. Sign into your SendWithUs account.
2. Click **Delivery Settings** in the left nav tab.
3. In your list of Email Service Providers (ESP), find the one you want to add the webhook to.
4. Click the **Actions** menu for that ESP, then click **Settings**.
5. The Account Settings for the ESP will display. In the **Forward Webhooks To** field, paste your Stitch-generated webhook URL:

   ![Setting up webhooks in SendWithUs]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/sendwithus-webhook-setup.png)
6. Click **Save**.

#### New Email Service Providers

**If you're brand new to SendWithUs and haven't yet set up an ESP,** you can define the webhook during the initial setup for most ESPs by pasting your Stitch webhook URL in the **Forward Webhooks To** field. For example:

![Setting up webhooks for a new ESP in SendWithUs]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/sendwithus-new-esp-webhook-setup.gif)

The data sent by SendGrid's webhook API is based entirely off of the ESP that you're using. For example: say you're using Mandrill as your ESP. The schema of the table created by Stitch **for your Mandrill ESP** will look different than a table created for a SparkPost ESP.
