[These instructions from Contentful](https://www.contentful.com/developers/docs/concepts/webhooks/) will get you started on how to do this in the web app.

When creating the webhook, note that:

- **The entire webhook URL generated by Stitch** must be pasted into the URL field.
- As the Stitch webhook URL contains a token for authorization, **the HTTP Auth fields aren't required**.

Contentful gives you the ability to send **ALL** events through the webhook, or to choose the specific ones that you want. The schema of the table created in your Stitch data warehouse will vary depending on the events you choose.

Once you've finished setting up the webhook and selecting events in Contentful, click **Save**.

### Contentful's Webhook Activity Log
Want to check out the raw JSON records Contentful sends to Stitch Incoming Webhooks? Confused about how fields in the Incoming Webhooks table are named?

You can use the Activity Log in the Contentful web app to see how records for different types of events are named and structured. You can do this by clicking the **Activity Log** tab in the **Webhooks** page.
