      ### Primary Keys
      While FormKeep tables won't have a designated Primary Key, you can use all the columns in the table in conjunction with the `created_at` column to create a composite key that identifies unique records. Some forms will likely only be submitted once (such as for an email list) but others may be used multiple times. A feedback form is a good example of a form that a person may use multiple times.

    nested-structures: false
    attribute-notes: |
      Other than the `_sdc` columns and a `created_at` column, the attributes contained in this table will depend on the fields that exist in your FormKeep form.

      For example: you have a partner signup form on your website that asks for a first name, last name, company name, website, and email address. In this case, your table might look like this:
    attributes:
      - name: created_at
      - name: first_name
      - name: last_name
      - name: company_name
      - name: website
      - name: email_address

{% contentfor setup %}
{% capture notice-content %}
There are two ways to set up webhooks in FormKeep: Via a custom URL in the FormKeep app or using Zapier's FormKeep integration.

If your form is already using a custom webhook URL in FormKeep, you'll need to:

1. **Use Stitch's Zapier integration** instead of **FormKeep**. This is because of how Primary Keys are defined between the Zapier and FormKeep integrations.
  
2. After generating your Stitch webhook URL, follow the instructions for [setting up a FormKeep integration in Zapier](#zapier-formkeep-integration).
{% endcapture %}

{% capture prerequisites %}
{% include important.html first-line="**Already using a FormKeep webhook URL?**" content=notice-content %}
{% endcapture %}

{% include integrations/webhooks/webhook-setup.html %}

**If another webhook URL is currently in use for your form**, you'll have to use [Zapier's FormKeep integration](#zapier-formkeep-integration) to complete the setup.

Otherwise, you can use the instructions in the **Using a Custom Webhook URL** section, below.

#### Via a Custom Webhook URL {#custom-webhook-url}

1. Sign into your FormKeep account.
2. Using the drop-down menu under the FormKeep logo, **select the form** you want to add the webhook to.
3. After the settings for that form open, click the **Webhooks** option.
4. Scroll to the bottom of the Webhooks page.
5. In the **Webhook URL** field, paste your Stitch-generated webhook URL:

6. Click **Save**.

#### Via Zapier's FormKeep integration {#zapier-formkeep-integration}

{% include note.html type="first-line" content="You only need to complete the following if you're not using a custom webhook URL in the FormKeep app." %}

1. In Zapier, click **Make a Zap!**
2. On the **Choose a Trigger App** page, click **FormKeep**.
3. On the **Select FormKeep Trigger** page, click **Save + Continue**.
4. On the **Select FormKeep Account** page, select the FormKeep account you want to use. 

   **If you haven't previously connected the account**, you can find your API token by [clicking here](https://formkeep.com/account/zapier-token) when you're signed into your FormKeep account.
5. Click **Save + Continue** after you've selected the correct FormKeep account.
6. In the drop-down, select the **form** you want to use and then click **Continue**.
7. To test the setup so far, click **Fetch & Continue**. When the test successfully completes, click **Continue**.
8. Next, you'll select the Action, or where Zapier will send your FormKeep data. On the **Choose an Action App** page, scroll down to the **Built-in Apps** section and click **Webhooks**:

   ![Selecting the Webhooks integration in Zapier]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/zapier-webhooks-integration.png)

9. On the **Select Webhooks by Zapier Action** page, select the **POST** option and click **Save + Continue**.
10. Fill in the following fields:
  - In the **URL** field, paste your Stitch-generated webhook URL.
  - In the **Payload Type** field, select **JSON** from the drop-down menu. **Note that Stitch only accepts data in JSON format at this time** - if anything else is selected, the integration wonâ€™t work:

        ![Setting up webhooks for FormKeep in Zapier]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/formkeep-zapier-webhook-setup.png)

11. When finished, click **Continue**.
12. If you want to test the setup so far, you can do so now. When finished, click **Continue** to wrap things up.
13. Lastly, enter a **name** for your Zap, use the drop-down to **select a folder**, and then toggle the Zap to **on**.
