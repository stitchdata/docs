##  bigquery: "sometimes"
##  reason: "Segment sometimes sends records that contain multiple data types. BigQuery only allows `FLOAT` and `DOUBLE` data types in the same column; otherwise, the field will be rejected."

{% assign integration = page %}

{% contentfor setup %}
Connecting your Segment data to Stitch is a three-step process:

1. [Add Stitch as a selective integration](#stitch-selective-integration)
2. [Add Segment as a Stitch data source](#add-stitch-data-source)
3. [Authorizing Stitch to access Segment](#authorize-stitch)

### Add Stitch as a Selective Integration {#stitch-selective-integration}
{% include integrations/saas/segment-selective-integration.html %}

{% include integrations/shared-setup/connection-setup.html %}
4. Click {{ app.buttons.segment }}.

### Authorize Stitch to Access Segment {#authorize-stitch}

Lastly, you'll be directed to Segment's website to complete the setup.

1. Enter your Segment credentials and click **Login**.
2. From the dropdown menu, select the **Source** you want to send data from. **Note that Stitch will only ever read your data.**
3. Click **Send Data.**
4. After the authorization process successfully completes, you'll be redirected back to Stitch.
5. Click {{ app.buttons.finish-int-setup }}.
{% endcontentfor %}



{% contentfor replication-notes %}
Stitch uses what is called a [direct integration](https://segment.com/docs/partners/direct-integration/) to integrate with Segment. This is a webhook-based method of sending your Segment data to integrations. Unlike REST or SOAP APIs, **webhooks deliver data as it happens in real-time**.

In the event that our webhook service experiences downtime, you may notice some lag between an event occurring and the data appearing in your data warehouse.
{% endcontentfor %}



{% contentfor schema-notes %}
Each of Segment's endpoints contains a set of fields unique to that endpoint along with a set of common fields. Common fields are the same across all of Segment's endpoints.

Common fields describe user identity, timestamping, device, network, and so on. For a full list of these fields, check out Segment's [Common Fields](https://segment.com/docs/spec/common/) Spec.
