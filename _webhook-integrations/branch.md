For additional info on Branch webhooks, check out [Branch's webhooks documentation](https://dev.branch.io/getting-started/webhooks/guide/).

1. Sign into your Branch account.
2. In the side nav, click the [webhooks](https://dashboard.branch.io/webhook) option.
3. Click **Add a new webhook**. 
4. In the window that displays:
   - Paste your Stitch-generated webhook URL in the URL field.
   - Leave the method (`POST`) as-is.
   - Set the notification frequency using the drop-down menu. You can choose to receive a webhook for every single event occurrence or only for the first time that event is triggered for a unique user.
   - Set the [**event trigger**](https://dev.branch.io/getting-started/webhooks/guide/#event-trigger) using the drop-down menu.
5. When finished, click the **Add webhook** button.
