2. Click **Account** in the left nav tab.
3. Click **Webhooks**.
4. Click the **New Webhook** button.

5. In the **Target URL** field, paste your Stitch-generated webhook URL.
6. In the **Authentication** field, ensure that **None** is selected.
7. In the **Events** section, you can select the events you want to track. By default everything is selected, but to pick and choose, click **Select** and then use the checkboxes to select the events you want:

8. When finished, click **Add Webhook**.

### Testing the Setup
To ensure everything is set up properly, you can send a test call to your Stitch webhook by clicking the **Test** button next to the Stitch webhook and then clicking **Send Test Batch**:

If you encounter a `5xx` error (ex: `503 - Service Unavailable`), check the [Stitch Status Page]({{ site.status }}) to see if we've reported any issues.
