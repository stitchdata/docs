### Particle.io Webhook Limits
Before you dive into connecting Particle.io to Stitch, take note of the following:

1. **Particle.io allows a user to create up to 20 webhooks**.
2. A Particle.io webhook may be triggered up to 10 times per minute for every device registered to that user's account.
{% endcapture %}

{% include integrations/webhooks/webhook-setup.html %}

1. Sign into your [Particle.io console](https://console.particle.io/).
2. Click **Integrations** in the left nav tab.
3. Click **Webhook**.
4. In the **Event Name** field, enter the name of the event you want to track.
5. In the **URL** field, paste your Stitch-generated webhook URL.
6. The **Request Type** field should have **POST** selected - leave this as-is.
7. In the **Device** field, select the device you want to trigger the webhook:
