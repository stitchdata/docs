{% contentfor intro %}
Stitch’s Incoming Webhooks integration provides a simple and flexible method to integrate dozens of webhook APIs with Stitch. If Stitch doesn’t have a native integration for the webhook you want to integrate, then Stitch webhooks is your best bet. Webhooks are handy for anything that requires a notification and a potential follow-up response, including:

- Email events, such as bounces or spam
- Incoming support requests
- Incoming leads from a marketing website
- Important updates to product docs
- And so on!

## Prerequisites

To use Stitch Incoming Webhooks:

1. You must have a Stitch account.
2. **The Webhook API you're integrating with meets the following requirements**:
   - The data sent by the webhook API must come to Stitch in **JSON format**. This is currently the only format Stitch supports.
   - The payload (or delivery) of the data must come via a `POST` request.
   - Request bodies must be less than {{ site.data.import-api.general.max-record-size }}

You can determine if the webhook API you want to use meets the above criteria by checking out that provider's webhook API documentation.

### NULLs in Webhook Data {#nulls-webhook-data}

When working with webhook data, you'll likely notice that your data contains quite a few `NULLs`. There are two reasons for this: 

- The general nature of webhook data, and
- The design of the Incoming Webhooks integration

The Stitch Incoming Webhook integration is designed to create only one top-level table. This single table will contain all the data that Stitch receives from your webhook, which can include several types of records. For example: if you connect an email service like SendGrid using Incoming Webhooks, the table Stitch creates may contain records for `whitelist` events, `click` events, `bounce` events, and so on.

While each record type may contain some similar attributes (`id`, `created_at`, etc.), it's likely that each record type will have its own set of attributes, which will only be populated for that record type.

As such, some columns in some records will contain `NULLs`. Here's an example of a message send event, a whitelist add event, and a click event:

```markdown
| id | timestamp | event | action | type      | ip          | url           |
|----+------------+-------+--------+-----------+-------------+---------------|
| 1  | 1481730892 | send  | NULL   | NULL      | NULL        | NULL          |
| 2  | NULL       | NULL  | add    | whitelist | NULL        | NULL          |
| 3  | 1481732465 | click | NULL   | NULL      | 54.88.76.97 | http://hi.com |

// record 1 is a message send event
// record 2 is a whitelist add event
// record 3 is a click event
```
