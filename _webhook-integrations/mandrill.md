## TABLE NAME
  - name: "data"
    doc-link: https://mandrill.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/205583287-Webhook-Format
    description: "attributes and data relevant to the events you select during the setup in the Mandrill app."
    notes: |
      If you're using a data warehouse that doesn't natively support nested structures, you may see more than one table in Mandrill's schema. These are subtables, which are a result of Stitch de-nesting the nested data structures in Mandrill's API so the data can be loaded into your data warehouse.

      Additionally, **this will result in a higher number of rows replicated than what's in the source.**

      Refer to Mandrill's Webhook documentation (linked below) for info about how their data is structured.
    replication-method: "Append-Only (Incremental)"
    nested-structures: false
    attribute-notes: |
      Depending on the events you selected during the setup in the Mandrill app, this table can contain data about the events in the list below.
