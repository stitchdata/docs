notice-first-line: "**PostgreSQL RDS as an input data source**"
notice-copy: |

  This article describes how to connect {{ integration.display_name }} **as an input data source.**

  If you want to connect a {{ integration.display_name }} instance as a **destination**, refer to the [Connecting an {{ integration.display_name }} Destination guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.postgres-rds | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Permissions in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - Create/manage Security Groups, which is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - View database details, which is required for retrieving the database's connection details
  - item: "**Permissions in PostgreSQL that allow you to create users.** This is required to create a database user for Stitch."
  - item: |
      **If using Log-based Replication**, you'll need:

      - **A database running PostgreSQL 9.4 or greater** Earlier versions of PostgreSQL do not include logical replication functionality, which is required for Log-based Replication.
      - **The `rds_superuser` role in your {{ integration.display_name }} database, if you want to use Log-based Replication.** [This role](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.html#Appendix.PostgreSQL.CommonDBATasks.Roles){:target="new"} is required to grant the `rds_replication` privilege to Stitch's database user.
      - **To connect to the master instance.** Log-based replication will only work on master instances due to a feature gap in PostgreSQL 10. [Based on their forums](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/12/788/){:target="new"}, PostgreSQL is working on adding support for using logical replication on a read replica to a future version.
  - item: |
      **If you're not using Log-based Replication**, you'll need:

      - **A database running PostgreSQL 9.3.x or greater.** PostgreSQL 9.3.x is the minimum version Stitch supports for PostgreSQL integrations.
      - **To verify if the database is a read replica, or follower**. While we always recommend connecting a replica over a production database, this also means you may need to verify some of its settings - specifically the `max_standby_streaming_delay` and `max_standby_archive_delay` settings - before connecting it to Stitch. We recommend setting these parameters to 8-12 hours for an initial replication job, and then decreasing them afterwards.

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.
