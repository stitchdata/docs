  This article describes how to connect {{ integration.display_name }} **as an input data source.**

  If you want to connect a {{ integration.display_name }} instance as a **destination**, refer to the [Connecting an {{ integration.display_name }} Destination guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.postgres-rds | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Permissions in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - Create/manage Security Groups, which is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - View database details, which is required for retrieving the database's connection details.
  - item: "**Permissions in {{ integration.display_name }} that allow you to create/manage users.** This is required to create the Stitch database user."
  - item: |
      **To verify if the database is a read replica, or follower**. While we always recommend connecting a replica over a production database, this also means you may need to verify some of its settings - specifically the `standby` settings - before connecting it to Stitch.

      On occasion, [the default values for the `standby` settings can prevent Stitch from successfully completing queries]({{ link.troubleshooting.postgres-hot-standby | prepend: site.baseurl }}), resulting in slow, intermittent replication. This is usually only an issue during historical syncs or when replicating large amounts of data (ex: a large table using Full Table Replication).

      If you find that the `hot_standby` setting is `on`, proactively increasing the following settings from 30 seconds to 8-12 hours can help prevent this issue:

      - `max_standby_archive_delay`
      - `max_standby_streaming_delay`

      After the initial historical sync completes, you can typically decrease these settings again.

      For an official explanation of these settings, [check out the Postgres docs](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.0/static/runtime-config-wal.html#GUC-MAX-STANDBY-ARCHIVE-DELAY).

# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
