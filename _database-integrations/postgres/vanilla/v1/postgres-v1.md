notice-copy: |

  This article describes how to connect {{ integration.display_name }} **as an input data source.**

  If you want to connect a {{ integration.display_name }} instance as a **destination**, refer to the [Connecting a Self-Hosted {{ integration.display_name }} Destination guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.self-hosted-postgres | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

requirements-list:
  - item: "**The `CREATEROLE` or `SUPERUSER` privilege.** Either permission is required to create a database user for Stitch."
  - item: |
      **If using Log-based Replication**, you'll need:

      - **A database running PostgreSQL 9.4 or greater** Earlier versions of PostgreSQL do not include logical replication functionality, which is required for Log-based Replication.
      - **The `SUPERUSER` privilege.** If using logical replication, this is required to define the appropriate server settings.
      - **To connect to the master instance.** Log-based replication will only work on master instances due to a feature gap in PostgreSQL 10. [Based on their forums](https://commitfest.postgresql.org/12/788/){:target="new"}, PostgreSQL is working on adding support for using logical replication on a read replica to a future version.
  - item: |
      **If you're not using Log-based Replication**, you'll need:

      - **A database running PostgreSQL 9.3.x or greater.** PostgreSQL 9.3.x is the minimum version Stitch supports for PostgreSQL integrations.
      - **To verify if the database is a read replica, or follower**. While we always recommend connecting a replica over a production database, this also means you may need to verify some of its settings - specifically the `max_standby_streaming_delay` and `max_standby_archive_delay` settings - before connecting it to Stitch. We recommend setting these parameters to 8-12 hours for an initial replication job, and then decreasing them afterwards.

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% endfor %}
    substeps:
      - title: "Install the wal2json plugin"
        anchor: "install-wal2json-plugin"
        content: |
          To use Log-based Replication for your {{ integration.display_name }} integration, you must install the [wal2json](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json){:target="new"} plugin. The wal2json plugin outputs JSON objects for logical decoding, which Stitch then uses to perform Log-based Replication.

          Steps for installing the plugin vary depending on your operating system. Instructions for each operating system type are in the wal2json's GitHub repository:

          - [Unix-based operating systems](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json#unix-based-operating-systems)
          - [Windows](https://github.com/eulerto/wal2json#windows)

          After you've installed the plugin, you can move onto the next step.

      - title: "Edit the client authentication file"
        anchor: "edit-client-authentication-file"
        content: |
          {% capture record-lines %}
          {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}host replication [stitch_username] {{ ip-address.ip | strip }} md5
          {% endfor %}
          {% endcapture %}

          {% assign all-record-lines = record-lines | strip %}

          Usually named `pg_hba.conf`, [this file controls how clients authenticate to the {{ integration.display_name }} database](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/9.4/static/auth-pg-hba-conf.html){:target="new"}. To ensure Stitch can read the output from the wal2json plugin, you'll need to add replication connection rules to this file. These rules translate to _"Allow the Stitch user from this IP address to perform replication on all the databases it has access to."_

          1. Log into your {{ integration.display_name }} server as a superuser.
          2. Locate the `pg_hba.conf` file, usually stored in the database cluster's data directory. You can also locate this file by checking the value of the `hba_file` server parameter.
          3. Add the following lines to `pg_hba.conf`:

             ```conf
             {{ all-record-lines }}
             ```

             A rule for each of Stitch's IP addresses must be added to `pg_hba.conf`. As Stitch can use any one of these IP addresses to connect during the extraction process, each of them must have their own replication connection rule.

          After you've finished [editing the pg_hba.conf file](#edit-client-authentication-file) and [configuring the database settings](#configure-database-parameters), restart your {{ integration.display_name }} service to ensure the changes take effect.
