  This article describes how to connect {{ integration.display_name }} **as an input data source.**

  If you want to connect a {{ integration.display_name }} instance as a **destination**, refer to the [Connecting a {{ integration.display_name }} Destination guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.heroku-postgres | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
