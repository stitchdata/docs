  This article describes how to connect {{ integration.display_name }} **as an input data source.**

  If you want to connect a {{ integration.display_name }} instance as a **destination**, refer to the [Connecting a Self-Hosted {{ integration.display_name }} Destination guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.cloudsql-postgres | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

requirements-list:
  - item: "**Permissions in PostgreSQL that allow you to create users.** This is required to create a database user for Stitch."
  - item: "**To be running PostgeSQL 9.3+ or greater**. PostgreSQL 9.3.x is the minimum version Stitch supports for PostgreSQL integrations."

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
