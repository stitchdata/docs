notice-first-line: "**Google CloudSQL PostgreSQL as an input data source**"
notice-copy: |

  This article describes how to connect {{ integration.display_name }} **as an input data source.**

  If you want to connect a {{ integration.display_name }} instance as a **destination**, refer to the [Connecting a Self-Hosted {{ integration.display_name }} Destination guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.cloudsql-postgres | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

requirements-list:
  - item: "**Permissions in PostgreSQL that allow you to create users.** This is required to create a database user for Stitch."
  - item: "**To be running PostgeSQL 9.3+ or greater**. PostgreSQL 9.3.x is the minimum version Stitch supports for PostgreSQL integrations."
  - item: |
      **To verify if the database is a read replica, or follower**. While we always recommend connecting a replica over a production database, this also means you may need to verify some of its settings - specifically the `max_standby_streaming_delay` and `max_standby_archive_delay` settings - before connecting it to Stitch. We recommend setting these parameters to 8-12 hours for an initial replication job, and then decreasing them afterwards.

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "whitelist stitch ips"

  - title: "Locate database connection details"
    anchor: "locate-database-connection-details"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll locate the {{ integration.display_name }} database's IP address in the Google Cloud Platform console. This will be used to complete the setup in Stitch.

      {% include shared/google-cloud-platform/locate-database-details.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "#connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.

    substeps:
      - title: "Define the database connection details"
        anchor: "define-connection-details"
        content: |
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/database-integration-settings.html %}

      - title: "Create a replication schedule"
        anchor: "create-replication-schedule"
        content: |
          {% include integrations/shared-setup/replication-frequency.html %}
