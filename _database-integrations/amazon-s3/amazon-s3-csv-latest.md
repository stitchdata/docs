# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.** Signing up is free - [click here](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="new"} or go to `https://aws.amazon.com` to create an account if you don't have one already.
  - item: |
      **Permissions to manage S3 buckets in AWS**. Your AWS user must be able to add/modify bucket policies. During the setup process, Stitch will provide you with a bucket policy which will allow Stitch to access the bucket. This must be added to the bucket for Stitch to connect successfully.

# -------------------------- #
#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

      4. In the **S3 Bucket** field, enter the name of bucket. Enter only the bucket name: No URLs, `https`, or S3 parts.

         For example: `com-test-stitch-bucket`

  - title: "Configure tables"
    anchor: "configure-tables"
    content: |
      Next, you'll indicate which CSV file(s) you want to include for replication. You can include a single CSV file, or map several CSV files to a table.

      In the following sections, we'll walk you through how to configure a table in Stitch.

      {% capture best-table-results %}
      For the best results:

      - **The names of files should adhere to your destination's limits for table names.** File names will be used to create a name for the table in the destination.

         Table name limits will vary by destination type. For example: Redshift table names cannot exceed 127 characters.
      - **Each file should have a header row with names that adhere to your destination's limits for column names.** This will vary by destination type. For example: Redshift column names cannot exceed 115 characters. 
      - **If including multiple files in a table, each file should have the same header row.** Including multiple files in a single table depends on the search pattern you define in the next step.

        **Note**: This is not the same as configuring multiple tables. See the [search pattern](#define-table-search-pattern-and-name) section below for examples.
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include note.html first-line="**Tips for setting up CSV files**" content=best-table-results %}

    substeps:
      - title: "Define the table's search pattern and name"
        anchor: "define-table-search-pattern-and-name"
        content: |
          The **Search Pattern** field accepts the name of a single file (ex: `customers.csv`) or a regular expression, which can be used to include multiple files. What you enter into this field depends on how data for a particular entity is updated.

          **If a single file is replaced in your S3 bucket at some interval**, it would make sense to enter location of the file. For example: Customer data is added to and updated in a single file named `customers.csv`, located in the `analytics` folder of the bucket:

          ```
          /analytics/customers.csv
          ```

          In other cases, **there may be multiple files that contain data for an entity**. For example: Every day a new CSV file is generated with new/updated customer data, and it follows the naming convention of `customers-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`.

          To ensure data is correctly captured, you'd want to enter a search pattern that would match all files beginning with `customer`, regardless of the date in the file name. This would map all files in the `analytics` folder that begin with `customers` to a single table:

          ```
          /analytics/customers.*csv
          ```

          This search pattern would match `customers-2018-07-01.csv`, `customers-2018-07-02.csv`, `customers-2018-07-03.csv`, etc., and ensure files are replicated as they're created or updated.

      - title: "Define the table's name"
        anchor: "define-table-name"
        content: |
          When creating table names, keep in mind that each destination has its own rules for how tables can be named. As a result, some table names may have to be transformed to adhere to the destination's naming rules. Refer to the [Table name transformations](#table-name-transformations) section for more info and examples.

          {% capture table-name-limit-notice %}
          The value entered here should adhere to your destination's length limit for table names. If the table name exceeds the destination's limit, the [destination will reject the table entirely]({{ link.destinations.storage.rejected-records | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

          Table name limits vary by destination type:

          {% assign destinations = site.destinations | where:"destination",true | sort:display_name %}

          {% for destination in destinations %}
          {% case destination.table-name-limit %}
          {% when 'n/a' %}
          {% capture table-name-limit %}
          Not applicable to this destination
          {% endcapture %}
          {% else %}
          {% capture table-name-limit %}
          Limited to **{{ destination.table-name-limit }} characters**
          {% endcapture %}
          {% endcase %}
          - **{{ destination.display_name }}** - {{ table-name-limit }}
          {% endfor %}
          {% endcapture %}

          {% include important.html content=table-name-limit-notice %}

      - title: "Define the table's Primary Key"
        anchor: "define-table-primary-key"
        content: |
          {% include note.html type="single-line" content="This step is optional." %}

          In the **Primary Key** field, enter one or more header fields (separated by commas) Stitch can use to identify unique rows. For example:

          ```
          account_id,date
          ```

          If undefined, Stitch will load data into the table in an append-only fashion. This means that existing rows in the destination won't be updated, but will be appended to the end of the table. Refer to the [Primary Keys and Append-Only Replication](#primary-keys-append-only) section below for more info and examples.

      - title: "Specify datetime fields"
        anchor: "specify-datetime-fields"
        content: |
          {% include note.html type="single-line" content="This step is optional." %}

          In the **Specify datetime fields** field, enter one or more header fields (separated by commas) that should appear in the destination table as `datetime` fields instead of strings. For example:

          ```
          created_at,updated_at
          ```

          If undefined, Stitch will load all columns into the destination as an integer, number of string. For more details see the [Column name transformations](#column-name-transformations) section.

      - title: "Configure additional tables"
        anchor: "configure-additional-tables"
        content: |
          If you want to add another table, click the **Configure another table?** link below the **Specify datetime fields** field. Otherwise, move onto the [Sync historical data](#define-historical-sync) section.

           Stitch doesn't enforce a limit on the number of tables that you can configure for a single integration.

  - title: "historical sync"
    ## For this, we should note that setting this date will replicate all files in full that have been modified since the date set here

    content: |
      For example: Let's say we've added a `customers.*\csv` search pattern and set the integration's historical **Start Date** to 1 year. During the initial replication job, Stitch will replicate the contents of all files that match the search pattern that have been modified in the past year.

      Refer to the [Using file modification timestamps as Replication Keys](file-updated-at-replication-key) section for more info on initial and subsequent replication jobs for {{ integration.display_name }}.

  - title: "Grant bucket access to Stitch"
    anchor: "grant-bucket-access-to-stitch"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="You must have permissions that allow you to manage S3 buckets in AWS to complete this step." %}
      Next, Stitch will display a **Grant & Verify Access** page. This page contains the info you need to configure bucket access for Stitch, which is accomplished via a bucket policy. [A bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-policy-language-overview.html) is JSON-based access policy language to manage permissions to bucket resources.

      **Note**: The policy Stitch provides is an auto-generated policy unique to the specific bucket you entered in the setup page.

      For more info about the top-level permissions the Stitch bucket policy grants, click the link below.
