      Next, you'll indicate which CSV file(s) you want to include for replication. You can include a single CSV file, or map several CSV files to a table. Refer to the [Setup requirements section](#setup-requirements) for info about what Stitch supports for {{ integration.display_name }} files.

      In the following sections, we'll walk you through how to configure a table in Stitch:

      {% for substep in step.substeps %}

                included-in-discovery: "<strong>false</strong>"
            content: |
              At the start of each replication job, Stitch will analyze the header rows in the first five files returned by the table's [search pattern](#define-table-search-pattern). The header rows in these files are used to determine the table's schema.

              For this reason, the structure of files replicated using {{ integration.display_name }} should be the same for every file included in a table's configuration. If the header row in an included file changes after the fifth file, Stitch will not detect the difference.

              For example: Based on the files in the table below, the table created from these files would have `id`, `name`, and `active` columns. The `has_magic` column in the `customers-001.csv` file will not be detected, as it's not in the first five files.

              {% assign columns = "included-in-discovery|file-name|header-row" | split:"|" %}

            summary: "Type the data in discovered columns"
            content: |
              To determine data types, Stitch will analyze the first 1,000 rows in the [files included in object discovery](#discovery--objects).

              If a column has been specified as a [datetime column](#specify-datetime-fields), Stitch will attempt to parse the value as a date. If this fails, the column will be loaded as a nullable `STRING`.

              For all other columns, Stitch will perform the following to determine the column's data type:

              1. Attempt to parse the value as an `INTEGER`
              2. If that fails, attempt to parse the value as a `FLOAT`
              3. If that fails, type the column as a `STRING`. **Note**: If a column contains entirely null values, it will be created as an empty column in the destination with a type of `STRING`.

          After discovery is completed, Stitch will move onto extracting data.

          {% include replication/extraction/file-modification-replication-keys.html %}

          To reduce row usage, only include updated records in new files that match a table's [search pattern](#define-table-search-pattern). This will ensure that only updated records are replicated and counted towards your usage.

      How data replicated from an {{ integration.display_name }} integration is loaded into your destination depends on two factors:

      1. **If Primary Keys were specified for the table during integration setup.** If Primary Keys aren't specified during setup, Stitch will load data in an Append-Only manner. This means that new records and updates to existing records are appended to the end of the table as new rows.

      2. **If your destination supports upserts, or updating existing rows**. For destinations that support upserts, Stitch uses Primary Keys to de-dupe data during loading. {{ site.data.tooltips.primary-key }}

      **Note**: For Append-Only destinations, data will be loaded in an Append-Only manner regardless of whether a Primary Key is specified during setup.

    subsections:
      - title: "Loading with defined Primary Keys"
        anchor: "loading--de-duped-keys-example"
        content: |
          If the destination supports upserts and Primary Keys are defined during setup, Stitch will use the Primary Keys to de-dupe records during loading.

          This means that existing rows will be overwritten with the most recent version of the row. A record can only have a single unique Primary Key value, ensuring that only one version of the record exists in the destination at a time.

          For example: The following rows are replicated during the initial replication job:

          {% assign job = site.data.dataloading.examples.append-only | where:"job",1 %}
          {% assign fields = "id|name|type" | split:"|" %}

          {{ section.record-example-table | flatify }}

          Before the next job, the file containing these rows is modified. This means that Stitch will replicate the contents of the entire file, including the rows for `Finn` and `Jake` even if they haven't been updated.

          Stitch will use the Primary Key to de-dupe the records, making the table in the destination look similar to the following:

          {% assign job = site.data.dataloading.examples.append-only | where:"job",2 %}
          {% assign fields = "id|name|type" | split:"|" %}

          {{ section.record-example-table | flatify }}

      - title: "Loading without defined Primary Keys"
        anchor: "loading--append-only-example"
        content: |
          If the destination is Append-Only, or if Primary Keys aren't defined during setup, data will be loaded in an Append-Only manner.

          Additionally, Stitch will append a column (`{{ system-column.primary-key }}`) to the table to function as a Primary Key if one isn't defined.

          **Note**: Appending this column will not enable Stitch to de-dupe data, as a unique value is inserted every time a row is loaded, regardless of whether it's ever been replicated before. This means that a record can have multiple `{{ system-column.primary-key }}` values, each of them unique.

          For example: The following rows are replicated during the initial replication job:

          {% assign job = site.data.dataloading.examples.append-only | where:"job","1" %}
          {% assign fields = "__sdc_primary_key|id|name|type" | split:"|" %}

          {{ section.record-example-table | flatify }}

          Before the next job, the file containing these rows is modified. This means that Stitch will replicate the contents of the entire file, including the rows for `Finn` and `Jake` even if they haven't been updated.

          In the destination, the table might now look like the table below. Notice that records for `Finn` and `Jake` have been appended to the end of the table with new `{{ system-column.primary-key }}` values:

          {% assign job = site.data.dataloading.examples.append-only %}
          {% assign fields = "__sdc_primary_key|id|name|type" | split:"|" %}

          {{ section.record-example-table | flatify }}

          **Note**: Querying Append-Only tables requires a different strategy than you might normally use. For instructions and a sample query, check out the [Querying Append-Only tables guide]({{ link.replication.append-only-querying | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
