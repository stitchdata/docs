#      Feature Summary       #
# -------------------------- #

feature-summary: |
  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration replicates data using the {{ integration.driver | flatify | strip }} driver.


# -------------------------- #
#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: "**Privileges in {{ integration.display_name }} that allow you to create/manage users.** This is required to create the Stitch database user."
  - item: |
      **A {{ integration.display_name }} database using a version between {{ integration.versions | replace:"through","and" }}.** While older versions may be connected to Stitch, we may not be able to provide support for issues that arise due to unsupported versions.

      We recommend always keeping your version current as a best-practice. If you encounter connection issues or other unexpected behavior, verify that your {{ integration.display_name }} version is one supported by Stitch.

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll configure your {{ integration.display_name }} cluster to allow traffic from Stitch to access it. This is accomplished by whitelisting Stitch's IP addresses in the cluster's IP address whitelist in {{ integration.display_name }}.

      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html override-user-setup=true %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.

    substeps:

      - title: "Define the SSL connection details"
        anchor: "ssl-connection-details"
        content: |
          Click the **{{ defaults.field-names.ssl }}** checkbox. {{ integration.display_name }} requires SSL to connect successfully.

  - title: "{{ integration.setup-name }} Replication Keys"
    anchor: "mongo-replication-keys"
    content: |
      Unlike Replication Keys for other database integrations, those for {{ integration.setup-name }} have special considerations due to {{ integration.setup-name }} functionality. For example: {{ integration.setup-name }} allows multiple data types in a single field, which can cause records to be skipped during replication.

      Refer to the [{{ integration.setup-name }} Replication Keys guide]({{ rep-key | prepend: site.baseurl }}) before you define the Replication Keys for your {{ object }}s, as incorrectly defining Replication Keys can cause data discrepancies.

  - title: "Heavily nested data and destination column limits"
    anchor: "nested-data-replication-column-limits"
    content: |
      {{ integration.setup-name }} documents can contain heavily nested data, meaning an attribute can contain many other attributes.

      If your destination doesn't natively support nested data structures, Stitch will de-nest them to load them into the destination. Depending on how deeply nested the data is and the per table column limit of the destination, Stitch may encounter issues when loading heavily nested data.

      Refer to the [Nested Data Structures guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.

## Troubleshooting

### Fields Missing from Replication Key Menu

If fields you expect to see are missing from a collection's Replication Key menu, it may be that the fields aren't indexed. Refer to the [Mongo Replication Keys guide]({{ link.replication.mongo-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.
