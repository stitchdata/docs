  {% include misc/data-files.html %}

  In Stitch's MongoDB integration, projection queries serve as a method for selecting individual fields for replication. This is equivalent to [column selection]({{ link.replication.syncing | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in other integrations.

  By specifying a projection query, you can replicate only the data you need for each collection in your MongoDB integration.

  In this guide, we'll cover:

    summary: "The requirements for projection queries in Stitch"
    content: |
      Projection queries are compatible with any of Stitch's Replication Methods, including Log-based Incremental.

      Projection queries entered into Stitch must adhere to the following:

      - **Cannot exclude the `_id` field.** This is equivalent to `{ "_id": 0 }`. Stitch uses this field for replication.
      - **Cannot specify conditional criteria.** In SQL, this is equivalent to specifying a `WHERE` clause. For example: `{ "is_active": true }` is equal to `WHERE is_active = true`. This type of projection query is not currently supported in Stitch.
      - **Cannot combine inclusion and exclusion statements.** This means that a projection query can't both include and exclude fields. For example: `{ "name": 0, "type": 1 }`
      - **Must be valid JSON.** Projection queries must be valid JSON. Keys and string values must be enclosed in double quotes (`"`). You can use [JSONFormatter](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com/){:target="new"} to validate the projection query before entering it into Stitch.
      - **Must exclude the `_acl` field** if using access control list plugins with MongoDB. If the projection query is inclusion-based, then you must remove it.

      Projection queries that don't meet the above criteria will result in [errors during extraction](#error-troubleshooting).

          Return only the specified fields (`name`, `is_active`) for documents in the `customers` collection. Fields are marked for inclusion by setting their value to `1` in the projection query.

        description: |
          Return all fields except those that are excluded. Fields are marked for exclusion by setting their value to `0` in the projection query.

          **Note**: The `_id` field cannot be excluded in projection queries added in Stitch, as Stitch requires it for replication.

          In this example, the query would return only the `name` and `acquaintances` fields.
        projection-query: |
          ```json
          { "is_active": 0, "details": 0 }

          Using [dot notation]({{ site.data.taps.links.mongodb.dot-notation }}){:target="new"}, return specified fields in an embedded document. This is formatted as `"<embedded_document_name>.<field>"`

          In this example, the query would return the `name` and `name` and `type` fields from the `details` document.

          Refer to [MongoDB's documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/core/document/#embedded-documents){:target="new"} for more examples of dot notation for embedded documents.

          ```
        sql: |
          In destinations - like Snowflake - that also use dot notation to query nested data, the query might look like this:

          ```sql
          SELECT name,
                 "details.name",
                 "details.type"

           ```
        results: |
          {% assign results = section.data %}
          {% assign attributes = "name|details" | split:"|" %}

      - title: "Return specified fields in an embedded document in an array"
        description: |
          Using [dot notation]({{ site.data.taps.links.mongodb.dot-notation }}){:target="new"}, return specified fields in an embedded document contained in an array. This is formatted as `"<embedded_document_name>.<field>"`

          In this example, the query would return the `name` and `name` and `type` fields from the documents in the `acquaintances` array.

          Refer to [MongoDB's documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/v4.0/core/document/#arrays){:target="new"} for more examples of dot notation for embedded documents and arrays.

      In this section, we'll look at some example projection queries and their SQL equivalents.

      ### Example collection data {#example-collection-data}

      The examples use data from a collection named `customers`, which contains the following documents:

      {% assign results = section.data %}
      {% assign headings = "name (string)|is_active (boolean)|details (object)|acquaintances (array)" | split:"|" %}
      {% assign attributes = "name|is_active|details|acquaintances" | split:"|" %}
