#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.** Signing up is free - [click here](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="new"} or go to `https://aws.amazon.com` to create an account if you don't have one already.
  - item: |
      **Permissions in AWS Identity Access Management (IAM) that allow you to create policies, create roles, and attach policies to roles**. This is required to grant Stitch authorization to {{ integration.display_name }}.
  - item: |
      **If using Log-based Incremental replication, streams must be enabled in {{ integration.display_name }} for every table you want to replicate using this method.** Additionally, each stream must use the `New Image` or `New and Old Images` option in AWS. Refer to the [Replication](#log-based-incremental-replication-details) section for more info.

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

  - title: "Retrieve your Amazon Web Services account ID"
    anchor: "retrieve-aws-account-id"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/shared-setup/aws-s3-iam-setup.html type="retrieve-account-id" %}

      {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/configure-server-settings-intro.html %}

      For every table you want to replicate using Log-based Incremental replication, you'll need to enable {{ integration.display_name }} streams. Each stream must use the `New Image` or `New and Old Images` option in AWS or replication will be unsuccessful.

      Refer to [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html#Streams.Enabling){:target="new"} for instructions on enabling and configuring streams.

      {% capture notice %}
      **Note**: If using Log-based Incremental Replication, keep in mind that Amazon purges {{ integration.display_name }} streams after 24 hours. To ensure you don't lose data, set the integration's Replication Frequency to an interval less than 24 hours. For example: 12 hours.

      If Stitch identifies a stream that has aged out, Stitch will automatically reset the table and queue a full re-replication.

    summary: "Details about Log-based Incremental Replication via {{ integration.display_name }} streams"
    content: |
      Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration uses [{{ integration.display_name }} Streams](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html){:target="new"} to perform Log-based Incremental Replication. To use Log-based Incremental Replication, streams must be enabled on every table in {{ integration.display_name }} you want to replicate using this Replication Method. 

      Refer to [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/Streams.html#Streams.Enabling){:target="new"} for instructions on enabling streams for {{ integration.display_name }} tables.

      **Note**: The **Manage Stream** option must be one of the following, or replication will be unsuccessful:

        - `New Image`
        - `New and old images`
 
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: DynamoDB streams are purged after 24 hours.

  - title: "Full Table Replication"
    anchor: "full-table-replication-details"
    summary: "Details about Full Table Replication using scans and eventually consistent reads"
    content: |
      To perform Full Table Replications with Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration, Stitch uses scans to return data. A scan returns data by accessing all items within a table. As queries require you to specify the hash key (Primary Key), Stitch uses scans to simplify setup and replication. For more information about scans, click [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/APIReference/API_Scan.html){:target="new"}.

      Additionally, Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration only uses eventually consistent reads from your selected {{ integration.display_name }} tables. **Note**: This means that you will not see all of your recent data right away due to a delay from Amazon, but it will eventually catch up and return the latest records. For more information on {{ integration.display_name }} read consistency, refer to [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/amazondynamodb/latest/developerguide/HowItWorks.ReadConsistency.html){:target="new"}.

  - title: "Replication delays"
    anchor: "replication-delays"
    summary: "Details about expected delays in {{ integration.display_name }} replication"
    content: |
      Stitch can't replicate data from your {{ integration.display_name }} database until the shard is closed in your account. This can result in a delay in the replicaton of new data, as the new data is available only after the shard has been closed. Forcing an extraction in Stitch won't have any effect on replicating new data unless the shard is closed.
