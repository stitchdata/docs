#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Permissions in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - Create/manage Security Groups, which is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - View database details, which is required for retrieving the database's connection details.
  - item: "**Permissions in {{ integration.display_name }} that allow you to create/manage users.** This is required to create the Stitch database user."
  - item: |
      **A database that uses case-insensitive collation**. [More info about collation can be found here in Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/collations/collation-and-unicode-support#Collation_Defn).

## Based on this AWS doc, enabling mixed mode auth shouldn't be necessary:

#     Setup Instructions     #
# -------------------------- #

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Locate RDS connection details in AWS"
    anchor: "locating-rds-database-details"
    content: |
      {% include shared/aws-connection-details.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "#connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.

    substeps:
      - title: "Define the database connection details"
        anchor: "define-connection-details"

        anchor: "ssl-connection-details"
        content: |
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/database-integration-settings.html type="ssl" %}

  - title: "Create a replication schedule"
    anchor: "create-replication-schedule"
