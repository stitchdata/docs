#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Privileges in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - Create/manage Security Groups, which is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - View database details, which is required for retrieving the database's connection details.
  - item: "**Privileges in {{ integration.display_name }} that allow you to create/manage users.** This is required to create the Stitch database user."

  - item: "**A database running {{ integration.display_name }} version {{ page.versions }}.** {{ integration.display_name }} 2012 is the miminum version that Stitch supports for this type of integration."

  - item: |
      **If using Log-based Incremental Replication**, you'll need:

      - **The `ALTER DATABASE` privilege in Microsoft SQL Server.** This is required to complete the setup for Log-based Incremental Replication.

## Based on this AWS doc, enabling mixed mode auth shouldn't be necessary:

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"
    content: |
      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
