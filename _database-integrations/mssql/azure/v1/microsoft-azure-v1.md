  - item: "**Privileges in {{ integration.display_name }} that allow you to create/manage users.** This is required to create the Stitch database user."

      **If using Log-based Incremental Replication**, you'll need:

      - **The `ALTER DATABASE` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** This is required to complete the setup for Log-based Incremental Replication.
      - **A Primary Key in the source table.** This is required to use logical replication.

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
