#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: "**Privileges in {{ integration.display_name }} that allow you to create/manage users.** This is required to create the Stitch database user."

  - item: "**A database running {{ integration.display_name }} version {{ page.versions }}.** {{ integration.display_name }} 2012 is the miminum version that Stitch supports for this type of integration."

  - item: |
      **If using Log-based Incremental Replication**, you'll need:

      - **The `ALTER DATABASE` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** This is required to complete the setup for Log-based Incremental Replication.
  - item: |
      **A server that**:

      - Allows connections over TCP/IP
      - Allows mixed mode authentication

requirements-info: "**Make sure your server is set up properly before continuing**. If you need some help figuring out your hosting details, we recommend looping in a member of your engineering team."

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "create-a-database-user"

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

  - title: "Connect Stitch"

      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
