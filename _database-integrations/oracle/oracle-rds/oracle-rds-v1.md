#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Privileges in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - **Create/manage Security Groups**. This is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - **Modify database instances**. This is required to enable settings required for incremental replication.
        - **View database details**. This is required to retrieve the database's connection details.

  - item: |
      **Privileges in the {{ integration.display_name }} database that allow you to**:

        - **Access the `V$DATABASE` and `V_$THREAD` performance views.** These are required to verify setting configuration while setting up your {{ integration.display_name }} database and to retrieve the database's Oracle System ID. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]reference-docs.vdatabase }}){:target="new"} for more info on performance views.
        
        - **Create users and grant privileges.** The [`CREATE USER`]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]reference-docs.create-user }}){:target="new"} and [`GRANT`]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]reference-docs.grant }}){:target="new"} privileges are required to create a database user for Stitch and grant the necessary privileges to the user.

        - **`GRANT` access to the objects you want to replicate.**  This is necessary to grant the privileges necessary for selecting data to the Stitch database user. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]reference-docs.grant }}){:target="new"} for more info.

      {% for substep in step.substeps %}
      - [Step 2.{{ forloop.index }}: {{ substep.title }}](#{{ substep.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}

    substeps:
      - title: "Enable AWS automated backups"
        anchor: "enable-aws-automated-backups"
        content: |
          {% capture rds-backup-requirement %}
          1. Privileges in AWS that allow you to modify database instances.
          2. Rebooting the database for changes to take effect. Perform this step during off-peak hours to minimize disruptions.
          {% endcapture %}
          {% include note.html first-line="**Note: This step requires**:" content=rds-backup-requirement %}

          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/amazon-rds/define-database-settings.html content="backup-retention-period" starting-point="sign-in" %}

          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/amazon-rds/define-database-settings.html content="reboot-the-instance" %}

      - title: "Define ARCHIVELOG retention hours"
        anchor: "define-archivelog-retention-hours"
        content: |
          In addition to the [backup retention period](#define-backup-retention-period), you also need to define the `archivelog retention hours` setting. This parameter specifies the number of hours the database server should retain archive logs.

          To specify the number of hours, use the [rdsadmin.rdsadmin_util.set_configuration]({{ site.data.taps.links.oracle.amazon-oracle-rds.archivelog-retention-hours }}){:target="new"} procedure when logged into the {{ integration.display_name }} master instance.

          In this example, archive logs will be retained for seven days (`24 hours x 7 days = 168 hours`):

          ```sql
          {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.oracle.log-mode.rds | strip }}
          ```

          Stitch recommends a minimum of three days for the retention period, but strongly recommends seven.

      - title: "Enable supplemental logging"
        anchor: "enable-supplemental-logging"
        content: |
          In this step, you'll enable supplemental logging for the database. This ensures that columns are logged in redo log files when changes are made to the database, which is required by {{ integration.display_name }} to use LogMiner. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]supplemental-logging }}){:target="new"} for more info about supplemental logging.

          To enable supplemental logging, run:

          ```sql
          {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.oracle.supplemental-logging.rds | strip }}
          ```

          The result should be `PL/SQL procedure successfully completed`.

          Next, verify that supplemental logging was successfully enabled by running the following query:

          ```sql
          {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.oracle.supplemental-logging.command | strip }}
          ```

          If the result is `YES`, supplemental logging was successfully enabled.

  - title: "Create a Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} database user"
    anchor: "db-user"
    content: |
      {% capture create-db-user-step-notice %}
      **Note**: This step requires `CREATE USER` and `GRANT` privileges in {{ integration.display_name }}.
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include note.html type="single-line" content=create-db-user-step-notice %} 

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Retrieve the database's Oracle System ID"
    anchor: "retrieve-oracle-system-id"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/oracle-retrieve-sid.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.

      {% for substep in step.substeps %}
      - [Step 5.{{ forloop.index }}: {{ substep.title | flatify }}](#{{ substep.anchor }})

  - title: "Overview of Log-based Incremental Replication using LogMiner"
    anchor: "logminer-replication-integration"
    content: |
      Stitch uses {{ integration.display_name }}'s [LogMiner package]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.name]logminer }}){:target="new"} to replicate data incrementally. This means that when Log-based Incremental is selected as the Replication Method for a table, Stitch will only replicate new or updated data for the table during each replication job.

      To identify new and updated data, Stitch uses {{ integration.display_name }}'s [Approximate Commit System Change Numbers]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.name]reference-docs.commit-scn }}){:target="new"}, or SCNs, as [Replication Keys]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}). When reading from the database's logs, records with an SCN value greater than the maximum SCN from the previous job will be replicated.

      Refer to the [Log-based Incremental Replication documentation]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for a more detailed explanation, examples, and the limitations associated with this replication method.
