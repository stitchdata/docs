#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **The `CREATE USER` or `INSERT` privilege (for the `mysql` database).** The [`CREATE USER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html){:target="new"} is required to create a database user for Stitch.
  - item: |
      **The `GRANT OPTION` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** The [`GRANT OPTION` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_grant-option){:target="new"} is required to grant the necessary privileges to the Stitch database user.
  - item: |
      **If using Log-based Incremental Replication:**, you'll need:

      1. Privileges in Microsoft Azure that allow you to modify server parameters.
      2. A master server that adheres to [Microsoft's requirements](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/mysql/concepts-data-in-replication#requirements){:target="new"}.
      3. A MySQL database running MySQL version {{ integration.log-based-replication-minimum-version }} or newer.

        anchor: "configure-database-server-settings"
        content: |
          {% capture server-instructions %}
          1. In your **Azure portal**, locate and open the **Azure Database for MySQL** database you want to connect to Stitch.
          2. Click **Settings > Server Parameters**.
          3. Define the following server settings:

          {% assign server-settings = site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.server-settings.mysql.microsoft-azure-mysql %}

          {% for setting in server-settings %}
             - `{{ setting.name }}` - `{{ setting.value }}`
          {% endfor %}

             Refer to the **Server settings list** tab for more info about these settings.

          4. Click **Save** when finished.
          5. When finished, restart your MySQL server to ensure the changes take effect.
          {% endcapture %}
          
          {% include integrations/templates/configure-server-settings.html %}
          
      - title: "Retrieve server IDs"
        anchor: "server-id"
        content: |
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/mysql-server-id.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "db-user"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: You must have the `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges to complete this step." %} 

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch:

      {% for substep in step.substeps %}
      - [Step 5.{{ forloop.index }}: {{ substep.title | flatify }}](#{{ substep.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}

    substeps:
      - title: "Locate {{ destination.display_name }} connection details"
        anchor: "locate-connection-details"
        content: |
          In this step, you'll retrieve the server address for the {{ integration.display_name }} you want to connect to Stitch. 
          
          This is the value you'll enter in the **Host** field in Stitch in the next step.
