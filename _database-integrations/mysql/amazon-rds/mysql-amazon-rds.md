#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Privileges in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - Create/manage Security Groups, which is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - View database details, which is required for retrieving the database's connection details.
  - item: |
      **The `CREATE USER` or `INSERT` privilege (for the `mysql` database).** The [`CREATE USER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html){:target="new"} is required to create a database user for Stitch.
  - item: |
      **The `GRANT OPTION` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** The [`GRANT OPTION` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_grant-option){:target="new"} is required to grant the necessary privileges to the Stitch database user.

          In this step, you'll configure the database parameters required to use Log-based Incremental Replication.

## I believe this is only applicable to MySQL and not Aurora,

          **Enabling automatic backups is required to use Log-based Incremental Replication.** In Amazon RDS, enabling automatic backups also enables binary logging, which is what Stitch uses to perform Log-based Incremental Replication.

          Skipping this step or disabling automatic backups will cause replication issues in Stitch.

          Refer to the **Transaction Size** section of [Amazon's Importing Data into a MySQL DB Instance](https://docs.amazonaws.cn/en_us/AmazonRDS/latest/UserGuide/MySQL.Procedural.Importing.Other.html){:target="new"} documentation for more info.
