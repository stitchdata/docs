#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

notice: "Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration only supports MySQL-backed instances."

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **Privileges in Amazon Web Services (AWS) that allow you to**:

        - Create/manage Security Groups, which is required to whitelist Stitch's IP addresses.
        - View database details, which is required for retrieving the database's connection details.

  - item: |
      **To connect the master instance if using binlog replication.** As per [Amazon's documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonRDS/latest/AuroraUserGuide/AuroraMySQL.Reference.html){:target="new"}, binlog replication can't be enabled on Aurora read replicas as the `log_slave_updates` parameter is not modifiable.
  - item: |
      **The `CREATE USER` or `INSERT` privilege (for the `mysql` database).** The [`CREATE USER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html){:target="new"} is required to create a database user for Stitch.
  - item: |
      **The `GRANT OPTION` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** The [`GRANT OPTION` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_grant-option){:target="new"} is required to grant the necessary privileges to the Stitch database user.

  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Configure Log-based Incremental Replication"
    anchor: "configure-log-based-incremental-replication"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: Skip this step if you're not planning to use Log-based Incremental Replication. [Click to skip ahead](#create-a-database-user)." %}

      {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/configure-server-settings-intro.html %}
    substeps:
      - title: "Configure the database parameter group"
        anchor: "configure-database-parameter-group"
        content: |
          In this step, you'll create a new database cluster parameter group and configure the settings for Log-based Incremental Replication.
           
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/amazon-rds/aurora-rds.html %}

      - title: "Apply the parameter group to the database"
        anchor: "apply-parameter-group-to-database"
        content: |
          Next you'll apply the parameter group to the {{ integration.display_name }} database.

          1. In AWS, click the **Instances** option in the menu on the left side of the page.
          2. Select the instance you're connecting to Stitch.
          3. Click **Instance actions > Modify**.
          4. In the **Modify DB Instance** page, scroll down to the **Database options** section.
          5. From the **DB parameter group** dropdown, select the parameter group you created in the previous step.

    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="You must have the `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges to complete this step." %} 

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"

      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
