notice: |
  This article only applies to **MySQL-based** CloudSQL databases.

  If you want to connect a **PostgreSQL-based** CloudSQL instance, use [these instructions]({{ link.integrations.database-integration | prepend: site.baseurl | replace: "INTEGRATION","google-cloudsql-postgresql" }}).

requirements-list:
  - item: "**The `CREATE USER` or `INSERT` privilege (for the `mysql` database).** The [`CREATE USER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html) is required to create a database user for Stitch."
  - item: "**The `GRANT OPTION` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** The [`GRANT OPTION` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_grant-option) is required to grant the necessary privileges to the Stitch database user."

#     Setup Instructions     #

  - title: "whitelist stitch ips"

# https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/mysql/configure-ip

  - title: "Locate database connection details"
    anchor: "locate-database-connection-details"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll locate the {{ integration.display_name }} database's IP address in the Google Cloud Platform console. This will be used to complete the setup in Stitch.

      {% include shared/google-cloud-platform/locate-database-details.html %}

  - title: "Enable automated backups and binary logging"
    anchor: "enable-auto-backups-binary-logging"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/configure-server-settings-intro.html %}

      {% capture server-instructions %}
      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="integrations/cloudsql-enable-binary-logging.png" alt="" max-width="500px" %}
      1. On the **Instance details** page in Google Cloud Platform, click the **Edit** option at the top of the page.
      2. In the **Configuration options** section, open **Enable auto backups**.
      3. If unchecked, check the **Automate backups** option and select a window for automated backups.

         **Note**: This is required to use Log-based Incremental Replication.
      3. If unchecked, check the **Enable binary logging** option.
      4. Click **Save**.

      When binary logging is enabled, Google Cloud SQL will define the required server settings using their pre-defined defaults. Refer to the <a href="#server-settings-details" data-toggle="tab">Server settings list</a> tab for explanations of these parameters and their default values. **No other configuration is required on your part.**
      {% endcapture %}

      {% include integrations/templates/configure-server-settings.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "db-user"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="You must have the `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges to complete this step." %} 

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Retrieve server IDs"
    anchor: "server-id"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/mysql-server-id.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "#connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.

    substeps:
      - title: "Define the database connection details"
        anchor: "define-connection-details"
        content: |

      - title: "Define Log-based Replication setting"

        content: |
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/log-based-replication-default-setting.html %}
