#      Setup Requirements    #
# -------------------------- #

requirements-list:
  - item: |
      **The `CREATE USER` or `INSERT` privilege (for the `mysql` database).** The [`CREATE USER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/create-user.html){:target="new"} is required to create a database user for Stitch.
  - item: |
      **The `GRANT OPTION` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** The [`GRANT OPTION` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/8.0/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_grant-option){:target="new"} is required to grant the necessary privileges to the Stitch database user.
  - item: |
      **The `SUPER` privilege in {{ integration.display_name }}.** If using binlog replication, the [`SUPER` privilege](https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.6/en/privileges-provided.html#priv_super){:target="new"} is required to define the appropriate server settings.

setup-steps:
  - title: "Configure database connection settings"
    anchor: "connect-settings"
    content: |
      {% include integrations/templates/configure-connection-settings.html %}

  - title: "Configure Log-based Incremental Replication"
    anchor: "configure-log-based-incremental-replication"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="This step is only required to use logical (Log-based Incremental) replication." %}

      {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/configure-server-settings-intro.html %}
    substeps:
      - title: "Configure server settings"
        anchor: "configure-database-server-settings"
        content: |
          In this step, you'll configure your {{ integration.display_name }} server to use Log-based Incremental Replication.
          
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/vanilla-mysql.html %}
      - title: "Retrieve server IDs"
        anchor: "server-id"
        content: |
          {% include integrations/databases/setup/binlog/mysql-server-id.html %}

  - title: "Create a Stitch database user"
    anchor: "db-user"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="You must have the `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges to complete this step." %} 

      Next, you'll create a dedicated database user for Stitch. This will ensure Stitch is visible in any logs or audits, and allow you to maintain your privilege hierarchy.

      {% include integrations/templates/create-database-user-tabs.html %}

  - title: "Connect Stitch"
    anchor: "connect-stitch"
    content: |
      In this step, you'll complete the setup by entering the database's connection details and defining replication settings in Stitch.
