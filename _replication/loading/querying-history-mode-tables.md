  {% capture note %}
  - [Destinations configured to use History mode]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl | append:"#reference--destinations-loading-behavior" }})
  {% endcapture %}

  {% include note.html first-line="**This guide is applicable to:**" content=note %}

  When data is loaded using [History mode]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl | append:"#reference--destinations-loading-behavior" }}), records are appended to the end of the table as new rows. Only the `_sdc_end_date` column is updated in existing rows, to indicate when a new version was added. Multiple versions of a row can exist in a table, creating a log of how a record has changed over time.

  In this guide, we'll cover:

      Before using this guide, note that:

      - You may need to modify the queries in this guide to use them yourself
      - Stitch Support's expertise lies in replicating data, and as such does not provide data analysis or querying assistance. We can, however, help with data discrepancies.

         If you'd like assistance with analysis or business intelligence solutions, we recommend reaching out to one of our [analytics partners]({{ site.partners }}){:target="new"}.

      Let's take a look at an example. Assume we have an `orders` table that contains:

      - A Primary Key of `id`,
      - The system `{{ system-column.prefix }}` columns added by Stitch, and
      - Other order attribute columns

      If you wanted to get all current records, you could use the following query:

      {% capture code %}
          SELECT * FROM orders
          WHERE
            _sdc_end_date = "9999-12-31 0:00 +00:00"
      {% endcapture %}

      {% assign description = "Querying all current records" %}

      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: Since the `_sdc_end_date` value for current records is set to `9999-12-31` UTC, it is recommended to use `9999-12-31 0:00 +00:00` in your queries to make sure you get the correct result regardless of your local time." %}

      If you wanted to get all records valid on December 1st 2022, you could use the following query:

      {% capture code %}
          SELECT * FROM orders
          WHERE
            _sdc_start_date <= "2022-12-01"

      If you wanted to get the version of a record with the ID `694` valid in all of December 2022, you could use the following query:

      {% capture code %}
          SELECT * FROM orders
          WHERE
            id = 694
            AND _sdc_start_date <= "2022-12-01"

    summary: "How to simplify querying by creating a view in your destination"
    content: |
      To make this easier, you can turn queries like the one above into a view. We recommend this approach because a view will encapsulate all the logic and simplify the process of querying against the latest version of your data.

      Refer to the documentation for your destination for more info on creating views:
