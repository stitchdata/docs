      {{ page.summary }} In this guide, we'll cover:

      - [Data selection support for each integration](#table-column-selection-support),
      - [How to set data to replicate](#set-data-to-replicate), and
      - [How to troubleshoot common data selection issues](#troubleshooting-common-issues)

      {% include misc/icons.html %}

      Below is the level of support each integration has for table and column selection:

      - {{ supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","Supported" }} indicates that table/column selection is supported for the integration. **Note**: Only the data you select will be replicated. If nothing is selected, the integration will have a status of `Not Configured`.

      - {{ not-supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","Not supported" }} indicates that table and/or column selection isn't supported for the integration:

          - **For table selection**, all available tables and columns will be automatically set to replicate. For detailed info on the data Stitch replicates from [SaaS integrations]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas), check out the **Schema** section of any integration's guide.
          - **For column selection**, all available columns in the tables you select will be automatically set to replicate.

  - title: "Set data to replicate"
    anchor: "set-data-to-replicate"
    content: |
      To set data to replicate, click into the integration from the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} page and find the table or column you want to replicate. Then, {{ app.menu-paths.sync | replace: "Click","click" }} Keep in mind that:

      - **For database integration tables**, all columns will be set to replicate automatically. Additionally, you'll be prompted to select a [Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for tables that you set to replicate.

        **Note**: For MongoDB integrations, fields are selected by using [projection queries]({{ link.integrations.mongodb-projection-queries | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in the **Collection Settings** page.
      - **For SaaS integration tables that support column selection**, you can select columns by clicking on the **table name** and then tracking columns to replicate.

      **Note**: Parent objects - or objects that contain other objects - must be set to replicate for the objects they contain to replicate. For example: For a column to replicate, the table that contains it must also be selected. If applicable, so must the schema containing the table, and the database containing the schema.

          What happens when you've added a brand-new column in the data source or you want to replicate additional columns on an already-replicating table?

          For more info check out the [Syncing New and Additional Columns]({{ link.replication.syncing-new-columns | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide.

      - title: "Select database views"
        anchor: "select-database-views"
        content: |
          While the steps for replicating a database view are almost the same as those for replicating a table, there are some slight differences.

          For more info check out the [Replicating Database Views]({{ link.replication.db-views | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide.

      - [{{ subsection.title }}]({{ subsection.anchor }})

    subsections:
      - title: "Missing objects"
        anchor: "missing-objects"
        content: |
          ```
          Stitch cannot detect any objects (databases, tables, etc.) at or below this level.
          ```

          If you receive this message or you can't find an object (database, table, column, etc.), [it's typically a permissions issue]({{ link.troubleshooting.missing-objects | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

      - title: "Not supported table/column messages"
        anchor: "not-supported-table-column-message"
        content: |
          If you see a status of `Not Supported` for a table or column in a database integration, there a few potential root causes:

          - **Insufficient permissions.** Verify that the Stitch user has all the required permissions as outlined in the **Setup** instructions for the database. Refer to the documentation for [your database]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases) for more info.

             After you grant the required permissions and a full replication cycle has completed, the table's **Sync Status** should change to `Supported` and be available for syncing.
          - **Unsupported column.** If a column is displayed as `Not Supported`, it may be that the column contains an [unsupported data type]({{ link.troubleshooting.unsupported-data-types | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

      - title: "Parent object not set to replicate"
        anchor: "parent-object-not-set-to-replicate"
        content: |
          ```
          The table containing these columns is not set to sync. Please sync the parent table to ensure replication of columns selected on this screen.
          ```

          If you receive this message, it means that the object above it isn't set to replicate. For example: The table that contains a selected column isn't set to replicate. [Parent objects must be selected for the objects they contain to also replicate](#set-data-to-replicate).
