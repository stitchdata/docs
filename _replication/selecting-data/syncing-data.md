      This guide is applicable to all database and SaaS integrations.

      **Note**: Webhook integrations don't support table and column selection. By default, all data sent to Stitch in a webhook message will be loaded to your destination. Refer to the webhook provider's documentation for info about possible attributes.

        anchor: "how-objects-are-discovered"
        content: |
          During the Discovery phase of Extraction, Stitch detects the objects available for replication in a data source. Sometimes called a structure sync, this process is how Stitch determines the structure of the tables and columns in an integration. Objects must meet the [selection requirements](#object-selection-and-replication-requirements) to display and be selectable in Stitch.

          In an integration's {{ app.buttons.tables }} tab, you can select the individual databases (if applicable), tables, and columns you want to replicate. Integrations will have a status of `Not Configured` until at least one table and column are selected.

      - title: "Levels of object selection support"
        anchor: "object-selection-support"
        content: |
          While the majority of Stitch's integrations support table and column selection, some may only support table selection, while others don't have any object selection support.

          When an integration doesn't support table and/or column selection:

          - **Table selection**: If an integration doesn't support table selection, all available tables and columns are automatically set to replicate. For detailed info on the data Stitch replicates from [SaaS integrations]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas), check out the **Schema** section of any integration's guide.

          - **Column selection**: If an integration supports table selection but not column selection, all available columns in selected tables will automatically be set to replicate.

          Refer to the [Object selection support reference](#table-column-selection-support) for more info about what each of Stitch's integrations support.

    subsections:
      - title: "Requirements to select an object"
        anchor: "selection-requirements"
        content: |
          **For an object to be selectable in Stitch**, all of the following must be true:

          - The user authorizing the integration has permission to access the object in the source
          - Stitch successfully completes Discovery, or a structure sync. Stitch will automatically detect new objects, but [a structure sync](#individual-objects--new-additional-columns) must complete before the object will display in Stitch.
          - **For tables**, there are additional requirements:
             - For SaaS integrations, the integration supports the API endpoint associated with the table. Refer to the [integration's schema documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas) for a list of available objects and endpoints associated with them.
          - **For columns**, there are additional requirements:
             - The column contains data typed using a [supported data type]({{ link.replication.supported-data-types | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Columns containing unsupported data types will display as [Not supported](#not-supported-table-column-message) in Stitch.
             - For SaaS integrations backed by Singer taps, the tap must either dynamically include the field or the JSON schema used to create the given table must contain the column. Refer to the [integration's schema documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas) for more info.

      - title: "Requirements to successfully replicate an object"
        anchor: "replication-requirements"
        content: |
          **For an object to replicate successfully**, the following requirements, along with the [selection requirements](#selection-requirements), must be met:

          - The object is set to replicate
          - [All parent objects are set to replicate](#parent-object-not-set-to-replicate). This means that an object that contains other objects must be set to replicate for the objects they contain to replicate.

            For example: For a column to replicate, the table that contains it must also be selected. If applicable, so must the schema containing the table, and the database containing the schema. You'll receive an [error in Stitch](#parent-object-not-set-to-replicate) if the parent object isn't selected.
          
          - The user authorizing the destination has the required permissions for your destination type
          - The name of the object adheres to your destination's requirements. Refer to the [documentation for your destination type]({{ link.destinations.main | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.
          - **For tables**, there are additional requirements:
             - The table and at least one column are set to replicate
             - The table has a defined [Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [Replication Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}), if applicable
             - For integrations that replicate files, the file meets the integration's requirements. For example: A [Google Sheet]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/google-sheets) must contain a header row and a second row of data.
             - The table doesn't exceed the maximum columns per table allowed by your destination type, if applicable
          - **For columns**, there are additional requirements:
             - The column contains at least [one non-`NULL` value]({{ link.troubleshooting.column-nulls | prepend: site.baseurl }})

              To set objects to replicate:

              1. Click into the integration from the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} page.
              2. Click the {{ app.buttons.tables }} tab.
              3. Locate the table or column you want to replicate. **Note**: If there's a parent object such as a schema, verify that it's also selected.
              4. {{ app.menu-paths.sync | replace: "replicate.", "replicate:" }}

                 When a table is selected, keep in mind that:

                 - **For database integrations**, all columns are automatically set to replicate. **Note**: The process varies slightly for **Amazon DynamoDB** and **MongoDB-backed** integrations, which use [projection expressions]({{ link.integrations.dynamodb-projection-expressions | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [projection queries]({{ link.integrations.mongodb-projection-queries | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to select columns.

                 - **For SaaS integrations that support column selection**, you need to select columns by clicking into the table. In the list of columns, click the checkbox next to the column you want to replicate.
              5. If setting a table to replicate, define the table's [Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}), if prompted. Only integrations that support configuring Replication Methods will display this prompt.

            content: |
              The **Select all** feature, located in an integration's {{ app.buttons.tables }} tab, allows you to select all of an integration's tables and columns with just a few clicks.

              When used to select all tables, the following occurs:

              - All tables and [supported columns](#selection-requirements) are set to replicate. **Note**: Database views are not supported with this feature and won't be selected.
              - Previous column selections are overwritten. **Note**: Selections aren't final until **Finalize Your Selections** is clicked. Clicking **Cancel** will restore your previous selections.
              - Tables with defined Replication Methods will continue to use that Replication Method.

          - title: "Requirements to use the Select all feature"
            anchor: "select-all--requirements"
            content: |
              To use the **Select all** feature, all of the following must be true for an integration:

              - The integration is backed by a Singer tap
              - The integration supports table selection. If the integration doesn't support table selection, all available tables and columns will be set to replicate by default.
              - **For database integrations**, there are additional requirements:
                 - **Stitch supports Log-based Incremental Replication for the database.** Some database cloud providers may not support the features Stitch requires to perform Log-based Incremental Replication, even if the source database supports those features. For example: Heroku doesn't currently support logical replication for PostgreSQL.
                 - **The Default Replication Method setting is available and enabled for the integration**. In addition to having Log-based Incremental Replication support in Stitch, the **Default Replication Method** setting must be available and enabled.

              - **For SaaS integrations**, there is an additional requirement:
                 - **The API the integration uses must allow the selection of all fields.** Some sources - like Google Ads and Microsoft Advertising - have compatibility rules that determine the combinations of fields that can be selected together. Selecting all columns for these integrations would result in incompatible combinations and unsuccessful replication.

              Refer to the [Object selection support reference](#table-column-selection-support) for a list of integrations that support this feature.

          If you see a status of `Not Supported` for a table or column in a database integration, there a few potential root causes:

          - **Insufficient permissions.** Verify that the Stitch user has all the required permissions as outlined in the **Setup** instructions for the database. Refer to the documentation for [your database]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/databases) for more info.

             After you grant the required permissions and a full replication cycle has completed, the table's **Sync Status** should change to `Supported` and be available for syncing.
          - **Unsupported column.** If a column is displayed as `Not Supported`, it may be that the column contains an [unsupported data type]({{ link.troubleshooting.unsupported-data-types | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
