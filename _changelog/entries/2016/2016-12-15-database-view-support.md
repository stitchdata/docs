With the new year fast approaching, the Stitch engineers wanted to slip in a last update or two to the product before the ball drops. Customers can now [see and replicate views for database integrations]({{ site.data.urls.replication.db-views | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in Stitch - just pick a Primary Key and Replication Method. Enjoy!
