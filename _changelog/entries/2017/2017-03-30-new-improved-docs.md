Stitch is excited to relaunch a redesigned version of our extensive documentation, including a brand new [Getting Started guide]({{ site.data.urls.getting-started.basic-concepts | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and a [guide on picking the right destination]({{ site.data.urls.destinations.overviews.choose-destination | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for you.
