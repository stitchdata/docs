You can now opt out of system notification emails, freeing up inbox space and keeping your team on track. We'll still let you know in-app if we run into any issues replicating data and via email for any billing information.

Check out the [docs]({{ site.data.urls.account.manage-notification-settings | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) for more info.
