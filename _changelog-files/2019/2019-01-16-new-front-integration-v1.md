[{{ this-connection.display_name }}](https://frontapp.com){:target="new"} lets you manage all of your communication channels — email, social media, chat, SMS — in one place, and helps your team collaborate around every message. With the new Stitch integration, you can extract team member statistics related to conversations, messages, reaction times and more. Choose the granularity you need by selecting between an hourly or daily breakdown of your data.

Get started by creating a new {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration or learning more in [our documentation]({{ this-connection.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}).
