We've renamed the **Extraction Logs** page to simply **Extractions**.

We've also added new buttons to [Run Extraction Now and Stop Extraction]({{ site.data.urls.replication.start-stop-extraction | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) for those times when you need a little more control over when Stitch extracts data from your data sources.
