Want to be notified when data is loaded into your Stitch destination? With our new notification feature, you can!

Post-load webhooks send a webhook to a configurable address each time data is loaded into your destination. This new feature enables you to prompt other systems and processes to act on the data loaded by Stitch.

Itâ€™s available for our Enterprise customers, and you can try it out during a 14-day free trial. Learn more in our [docs]({{ site.data.urls.account.post-load-notifications | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}).
