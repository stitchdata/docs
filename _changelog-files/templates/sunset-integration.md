{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

The v{{ this-connection.this-version }} version of our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration has been sunset. As of today, this version of the {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration has been removed from Stitch and will no longer function.

Migrate to the latest version of {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v) today to continue replicating data.
