{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

A new version (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) of our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration is now available!

We've upgraded the {{ this-connection.display_name }} API version, made some updates to existing schemas, and replaced the deprecated `employees` stream with the `team_members` stream.
