We've updated our {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integration to fix the following error during the integration execution.

`conversations` records updated after previous sync start were missed in next sync because we were setting last sync end time as bookmark. We fixed this issue by bookmarking last sync start time.

Long running historical sync was stuck in loop after interruption because we were resuming sync from the beginning. Added nested filters in `search_query` to resume sync from the last processed conversations record.
