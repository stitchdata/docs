{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

We've updated our {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integration to fix the following issues during the integration execution: 

- We optimized the process of fetching stream data and resolved infinite loop issues in extraction runs.
- A limit to buffer size of fetched records to release has been added to optmize the memory consumption.
- Performance metrics calculations have been removed because they added additional overhead on tap performance.
- We also fixed some data loss issues in the interrupted synchronization scenario.
