In an effort to increase account security, we have introduced a new user role: General User. This makes it possible for you to separate users who handle account administration from those who are in the app to manage the Stitch pipeline. A General User can manage sources and destinations but cannot take any action tied to billing or accessing the Stitch account. Check out our [team member roles & permissions]({{ link.account.team-roles-permissions | prepend: site.baseurl }}) page to learn more about the General User role.
