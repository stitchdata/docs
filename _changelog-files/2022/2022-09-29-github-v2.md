{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

A new version (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) of our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration is now available!

We've improved the {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration by adding some new fields, as well as support for custom URLs.
