We've just released [Stitch Connect](https://blog.stitchdata.com/introducing-stitch-connect-816ef451784e){:target="new"}, a toolkit that enables developers to integrate a data pipeline with their own platforms behind the scenes as a seamless part of their infrastructure.

Stitch Connect comprises a JavaScript user interface and an API that lets developers programmatically create and access Stitch client accounts and configure source and destination connections.
