Loading Reports are now available!

A few months ago, we launched access to [Extraction Logs]({{ site.data.urls.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) for select integrations. Today, we're releasing additional transparency for replication, this time on the loading end of things.

All Stitch users can now see:

- A breakdown of row counts by tables (and subtables) for each integration
- A timeline of loads for each table
- Select integrations (MySQL, Facebook, Salesforce and HubSpot to name a few) have latest data point and extraction time info per table

Check out the [docs]({{ site.data.urls.replication.loading-reports | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) for more info.
