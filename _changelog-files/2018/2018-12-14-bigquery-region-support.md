Google BigQuery has begun adding additional region support (beyond the US and EU) for their users, and weâ€™ve just made these new regions available in Stitch for {{ this-connection.display_name }} ({{ this-connection.this-version }}) destinations. Stitch customers can now use Stitch with {{ this-connection.display_name }} instances in Tokyo, London, Singapore and Sydney.
