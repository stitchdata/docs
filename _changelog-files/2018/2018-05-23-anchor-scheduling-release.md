Stitch customers now have some control over when extractions begin. This new feature allows users to "anchor" extraction start times to a specific time, ensuring Stitch is predictably replicating data when it's most needed.

For example: Setting a six (6) hour replication with an anchor time of 12:00 PM would create this schedule:

- 12:00PM
- 06:00PM
- 12:00AM
- 06:00AM
