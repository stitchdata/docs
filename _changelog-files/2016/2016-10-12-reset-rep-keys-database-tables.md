Hot off the heels of support for [resetting the Replication Keys for an entire database integration]({{ site.data.urls.replication.reset-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}), Stitch now offers the ability to do it on a per table basis. Head down to the **Table Settings** in a database integration for an individual table and youâ€™ll see the new button.
