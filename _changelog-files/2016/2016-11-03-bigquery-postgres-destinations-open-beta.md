If Amazon Redshift isn't the right destination for you, then weâ€™ve got you covered. Our Google BigQuery and PostgreSQL destinations are now in open beta - and you can set them up in Stitch today! Both are available during destination selection in the onboarding process.

To learn more about how Stitch loads data into these destinations, check out the docs for [Google BigQuery]({{ site.data.urls.destinations.overviews.bigquery-v1 | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) and [PostgreSQL destinations]({{ site.data.urls.destinations.overviews.postgres | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}).
