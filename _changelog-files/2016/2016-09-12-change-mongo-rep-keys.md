Ever select the wrong Replication Key for a {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration when setting up Incremental Replication? If so, you'll know that it's a headache to change it.

Now, you can easily change it to the correct field within the Stitch app. Note that doing so will force a full re-replication of the table, to ensure all data is replicated using the correct Replication Key.
