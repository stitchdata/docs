The {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration now includes a table called `netsuite_deleted` which contains a row for every deleted record that supports deletes. 
Accounting for deleted records is especially important if youâ€™re performing any sort of aggregate function, such as totaling invoices or balancing your books. 

Learn more about utilizing the {{ this-connection.display_name }} deletion log in our [docs]({{ this-connection.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home | append: "#using-netsuite-deleted" }}.
