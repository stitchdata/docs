Donâ€™t like what you named your integration? Now you can change it!

Integration names can be edited on the **Settings** page for each respective integration. **Note**: Changing an integration's name won't change the name of the schema in your destination.

Learn more in the [docs]({{ site.data.urls.destinations.storage.stitch-schemas | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home | append: "#changing-schema-names" }}).
