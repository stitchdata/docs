We’re excited to report that Stitch supports the recently announced PostgreSQL flavor of the the Google CloudSQL service. It’s available as both an input [integration]({{ this-connection.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) AND a [destination]({{ site.data.urls.destinations.postgres | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) - a dual threat!
