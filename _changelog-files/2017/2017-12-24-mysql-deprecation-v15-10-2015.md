The v{{ page.connection-version }} version of our MySQL integration has been deprecated. As of today, this version of the MySQL integration is no longer formally supported.

While connections using v{{ page.connection-version }} will continue to run, this version will be sunset in the future. Migrate to the latest version of MySQL (v1) today to prevent possible disruptions.
