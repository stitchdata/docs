A new version (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) of our Google AdWords integration is now available!

A few highlights include:

- Utilizing the AdWords API to replicate the most popular Google AdWords reports to Stitch
- Configurable fields in each of your selected Google AdWords reports 
- Connect multiple individual or MCC AdWords accounts in each Stitch integration
- Using a 30-day conversion/lookback window to update data over the past 30 days
- Loading report data using [Append-Only loading]({{ site.data.urls.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) with an `_sdc_report_date` field so that users know when data was retrieved from the AdWords API
