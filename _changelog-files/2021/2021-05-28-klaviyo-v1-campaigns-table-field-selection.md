We've made some updates to our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration:

- **Field selection is now supported!** Select only the fields you want to replicate in the **Tables to Replicate** tab.
- **New `campaigns` table**. This table contains info about the campaigns in your {{ this-connection.display_name }} account.
