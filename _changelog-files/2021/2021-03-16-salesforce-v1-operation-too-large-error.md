We've updated the {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration to log `OPERATION_TOO_LARGE` errors more clearly. The following error will now display in the **Extraction Logs** when this issue is encountered:

```shell
OPERATION_TOO_LARGE: exceeded 100000 distinct who/what's. Consider asking your Salesforce System Administrator to provide you with the `View All Data` profile permission. (Stream: [STREAM_NAME])
```
