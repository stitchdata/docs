We've updated the export timeout error message for the `campaigns` table to indicate that the export will continue to be extracted in the next replication:

```
Mailchimp campaigns export is still in progress after [number] seconds. Will continue with this export on the next sync.
```

Previously, this message (`campaigns - export deadline exceeded ([number] secs)`) didn't clearly set expectations for the table during the next replication job.
