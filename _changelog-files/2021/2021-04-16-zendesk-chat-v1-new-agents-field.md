{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

A new field has been added to our {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integration!

The new `enabled_departments` field is now available for replication in the [`agents`]({{ this-connection.url | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#agents"}}) table.
