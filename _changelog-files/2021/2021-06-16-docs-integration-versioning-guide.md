After the v2 release of our PostgreSQL integration, we received some questions about how integrations are versioned. Today, we're adding a new resource to the docs to help answer these questions: [Understanding Integration Versioning and Upgrades in Stitch]({{ site.home | append: site.baseurl | append: site.data.urls.integrations.identify-integration-version }})

This new guide contains info about the process each version of our integrations goes through, what each version status (ex: `Beta`, `Released (Testing`) means, and how to identify which version of an integration you're using.
