Several fields have been added to the `pull_requests` table in our {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integration!

The `base` object contains details about the base branch used in a given pull request, including the repository it originated from.

Learn more in [our documentation]({{ this-connection.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home | append: "#pull-requests"}}).
