We've added a new guide to the Connect API resources!

Use the [Create a Destination with the Connect API]({{ site.home | append: site.baseurl | append: site.data.urls.connect.guides.create-configure-a-destination }}) guide to learn how to connect a destination to your Stitch account using the API. You can also use this guide to learn about the process for switching to a different destination.
