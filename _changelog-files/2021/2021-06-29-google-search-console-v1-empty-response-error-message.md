{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

To improve the experience of our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration, we've changed how we handle empty response errors.

Instead of bypassing the error without an explanation, the integration will now raise an error and display it in the Extraction Logs:

```shell
HTTP-error-code: 400, Error: The request is missing or has a bad parameter.
```
