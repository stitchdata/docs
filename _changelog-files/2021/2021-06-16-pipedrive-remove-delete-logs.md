{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

Due to {{ this-connection.display_name }} removing support for `delete_logs` from their API, we've removed this table from our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration. We've also updated the [{{ this-connection.display-name }} docs]({{ site.home | append: site.baseurl | append: this-connection.url }}) to reflect this.
