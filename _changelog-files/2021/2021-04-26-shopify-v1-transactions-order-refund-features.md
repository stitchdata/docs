We've made some improvements to how the `transactions` and `order_refunds` tables replicate in {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integrations:

- Bookmarking has been added to the `order_refunds` and `transactions` tables
- Error handling added to the `transactions` table to avoid 429 errors
