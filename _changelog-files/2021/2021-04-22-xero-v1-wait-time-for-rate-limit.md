{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

We've added a minute-long wait time to the retry logic for the {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration. This ensures that Stitch doesn't make too many requests to {{ this-connection.display_name }}'s API when retrying on a 429 error.
