We've determined that the `FieldHistoryArchive` object is incompatible with the {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration's current method of querying, and as a result have removed it from the integration.

Refer to the [tap repository](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-salesforce/blob/master/Blacklisting.md){:target="new"} for more info.
