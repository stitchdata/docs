{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

Our code is now explicitly forcing the use of UTC for timestamps for our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration.

Our requests to the {{ this-connection.display_name }} REST API weren't specifying a timezone while querying, and the integration assumed that no timezone retrieved meant UTC.  This update ensures times are consistently recorded in a UTC format.
