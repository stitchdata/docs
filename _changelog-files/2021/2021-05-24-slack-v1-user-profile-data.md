{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

We've added a new column to the {{ this-connection.display_name }} `users` table: `profile.email`. This column contains the email address for the associated user.

**Note**: To replicate this data, you'll also need to grant the `users:read.email` scope to the [Stitch app created for the integration]({{ site.home | append: site.baseurl | append: this-connection.url | append: "#assign-scopes" }}).
