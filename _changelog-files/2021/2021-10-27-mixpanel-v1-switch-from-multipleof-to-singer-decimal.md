{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

We've updated our {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integration to use the type `string` and format `singer.decimal` in funnels and revenue streams, instead of the type `number` and `'multipleOf': 1e-20`.

This change solves the issue where a schema mismatch error would be retuned when a value was out of range.
