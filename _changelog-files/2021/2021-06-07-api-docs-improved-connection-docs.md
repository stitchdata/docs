We've moved the documentation for connection property objects out of the Connect API reference and into their own reference: [Destination and Source Connection Property API Reference]({{ site.home | append: site.baseurl | append: site.data.urls.connect.guides.connection-reference }})

This new resource includes:

- An explanation of what connection properties are and how to use them
- Info about what connections are available in the API
- Details about the properties required to create and configure each available connection using the API
