{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

We've updated our {{ this-connection.display_name }} (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) integration to change the `replication_keys` and `bookmark_field` for the `gl_journal_entries` stream from `booking_date` to `creation_date`.

This change solves the issue where journal entries were missing when transactions were reversed.
