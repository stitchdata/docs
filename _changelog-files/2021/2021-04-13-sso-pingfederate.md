We've expanded our list of supported Identity Providers to include PingFederate!

Using a SAML SP connection, you can now configure Stitch to use SSO with your PingFederate instance. Check out the new [step-by-step guide]({{ site.data.urls.security.sso-pingfederate | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) for help getting set up.
