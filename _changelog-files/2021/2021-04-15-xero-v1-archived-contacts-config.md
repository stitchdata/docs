Archived contacts can now be included in replication for {{ this-connection.display_name }} integrations.

To replicate records for both archived and active contacts:

- **In the Stitch app**: Check the **Include archived contacts** setting in the **Integration Settings** page
- **In the Connect API**: Set the `include_archived_contacts` property for `platform.xero` to `true`

If this setting isn't enabled, Stitch will replicate data only for active contacts.
