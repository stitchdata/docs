A new destination is now in open beta, available to all customers: {{ this-connection.display_name }}.

Developed by Databricks, Delta Lake is an open-source storage layer that leverages the "lakehouse" paradigm. This allows you to implement similar data structures and data management features to those of a data warehouse, directly on the kind of low cost storage used for data lakes.
