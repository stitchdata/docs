{{ site.data.changelog.metadata.single-integration | flatify }}

A new version (v{{ this-connection.this-version }}) of our {{ this-connection.display_name }} integration is now available! 

Weâ€™ve worked hard to ensure this new integration is the best way to extract data from {{ this-connection.display_name }} to your Stitch destination. The new integration, based on the [Singer standard]({{ site.singer }}){:target="new"}, includes many new features such as:

- Removal of `square_` prefixes on table names
- Addition of the [customers]({{ this-connection.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home | append: "#customers" }}) table
- Several renamed tables:
	- `square_inventory` is now `inventories`
	- `square_location` is now `locations`
- Several record types are now replicated through top-level tables:
	- `fee` data is now replicated through the `taxes` table
	- `timecard` data is now replicated through the `shifts` table
- Removal of the `square_pages` table due to its [deprecation in the {{ this-connection.display_name }} API](https://developer.squareup.com/reference/square/catalog-api/v1-list-pages){:target="new"}
- User-facing [Extraction Logs]({{ site.data.urls.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }})
- [Table and field selection]({{ site.data.urls.replication.syncing | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }})
- [Enhanced scheduling options]({{ site.data.urls.replication.rep-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }})
- [Run and stop Extraction]({{ site.data.urls.replication.start-stop-extraction | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }}) on demand functionality
- Availability via the [Stitch Connect API]({{ site.data.urls.connect.overview | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.home }})
- Enhanced schema validation
