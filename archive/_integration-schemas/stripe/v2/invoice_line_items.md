  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the line items contained in invoices.

  **Note**: In order to replicate invoice line item data, the [`invoices`](#invoices) table must also be set to replicate.

  #### Invoice line item replication

  To replicate invoice line items, Stitch will use the Replication Key of the corresponding invoice in the [`invoices`](#invoices) table to detect new and updated records. This means that any time an invoice is updated, its associated line items will also be replicated.

  For example: An invoice with five line items is updated when its status changes from `draft` to `open`. The record in `invoices` will be replicated, as will the records for its five line items. In this example, a total of six records will be replicated.
