  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the subscriptions your customers have subscribed to. A subscription is a recurring item that customers are billed for, such as a plan or addon. It may also contain discount items.

  **Note**: {{ integration.display_name }} [does not update the `updated_at`](https://apidocs.chargebee.com/docs/api/subscriptions#subscription_updated_at){:target="new"} value when the following attributes on a subscription are modified:

  - `due_invoices_count`
  - `due_since`
  - `total_dues`

  Because of this functionality and Stitch's use of this value as a [Replication Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}), updates made to subscriptions where only these attributes are modified may not be detected. You should ensure that another attribute on the subscription is also modified to ensure that the `updated_at` value is updated, which will allow Stitch to detect and replicate the record.
