      The status of the bill. Possible values are:

      - `Draft` - Bill is yet to be authorised and sent by the Supplier and will not be used in any reports. It may contain incomplete line items.
      - `Open` - The Bill is no longer a draft. It has no payments made against it (`amountDue == totalAmount`).
      - `PartiallyPaid` - The balance paid against the Bill is positive, but less than the total Bill amount (`0 < amountDue < totalAmount`).
      - `Paid` - Bill is paid in full. This includes if the Bill has been credited or overpaid. (`amountDue == 0`)
      - `Void` - A Bill can become Void by being deleted, refunded, written off or cancelled. **Note:** A voided Bill may still be `partiallyPaid` and so all outstanding amounts on voided Bills are removed from the AP (Accounts Payable) account.
