          - `APPROVED` - Ad entity is approved for serving.
          - `REJECTED` - Ad entity is rejected.
          - `PREAPPROVED` - Ad entity has been preapproved; it's ready for serving but still needs further review.
          - `AUTO_APPROVED` - Ad entity has been auto approved by content model.
          - `NEEDS_REVIEW` - Ad entity has been rejected by content model or policy checker or returned by fallback case that auto approval didn't make any decision.

      The status of the creative. Possible values are:

      - `ACTIVE` - Creative creation is complete and creative is available for review and serve.
      - `PAUSED` - Creative creation is complete and creative is current, but should temporarily not be served.
      - `DRAFT` - Creative creation is incomplete and may still be edited.
      - `ARCHIVED` - Creative creation is complete, but creative should not be served and should be separated from non-archived creatives in any UI.
      - `CANCELED` - Creative is permanently canceled.

      Creative status is set independently from parent entity status, but parent entity status overrides creative status in effect. For example: Parent entity status may be `PAUSED` while creative status is `ACTIVE`, in which case creative is in effect `PAUSED`, and not served.
