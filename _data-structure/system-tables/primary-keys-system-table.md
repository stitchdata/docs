summary: "Some of Stitch's destinations don't have native support for Primary Keys. To ensure data can be de-duped during loading, Stitch will create a Primary Keys table for each integration schema."

key: "primary-key-system-table"

## The info about the _sdc_primary_keys table is kept in:

# -------------------------- #

sections:
  - title: "Applicable destinations"
    anchor: "applicable-destinations"
    summary: "The destinations this guide applies to"
    content: |
      This guide is applicable to the following destinations:

      - [Google BigQuery (v2)]({{ link.destinations.overviews.bigquery | prepend: site.baseurl }})
      - [Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse]({{ link.destinations.overviews.azure | prepend: site.baseurl }})

  - title: "Usage in replication"
    anchor: "usage-in-replication"
    summary: "How the {{ primary-keys-table.name }} table is used in replication"
    content: |
      Because [some destinations](#applicable-destinations) donâ€™t have native support for Primary Keys, Stitch uses the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table to store Primary Key information and de-dupe data during loading incrementally-replicated tables.
    
      De-duplicating data only applies to tables using an [Incremental Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This ensures that only the most recent version of a record is loaded into the table.

      [TODO- BQ destinations using append-only rep]

      Tables using [Full Table Replication]({{ link.replication.full-table-rep | prepend: site.baseurl }}) are not de-duped, but loaded in full during each replication job.

  - title: "Determining Primary Keys"
    anchor: "determining-primary-keys"
    summary: "How Stitch determines Primary Keys"
    content: |
      Depending on the data source type, Primary Keys are determined in one of two ways:

      - For **database integrations**, Primary Keys are defined by you in the source database. These will usually be columns with a Primary Key constrant or some other equivalent, depending on the type of database being used.

         **Note**: For [database views]({{ link.replication.db-views | prepend: site.baseurl }}) you set to replicate in Stitch, the Primary Key will be the field you define for the view during setup.
      - For **SaaS integrations**, Primary Keys are pre-defined by Stitch. Refer to the [schema documentation for your SaaS integration]({{ link.integrations.saas | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for info on the Primary Keys Stitch uses for specific tables.

      In every schema created by a Stitch integration will be a `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table. The Primary Key data for every table set to replicate will be stored in this table.

  - title: "Primary Keys table schema"
    anchor: "table-schema"
    summary: "The schema of the Primary Keys table"
    content: |
      The `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table contains the following columns:

      {% assign attribute-list=site.data.stitch.system-tables.sdc-primary-keys.attributes %}

      {% include stitch/stitch-system-table.html attribute-list=attribute-list %}

    subsections:
      - title: "Example tables"
        anchor: "example-tables"
        content: |
          For every column a table uses as a Primary Key, the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table will contain a row containing the table's name, the name of the column, and for Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations, the column's position in the Primary Key array Stitch receives.

          For example: If Stitch received the array `["email_id", "updated_at", "customer_id"]` for an `emails` table, the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table would contain the following records:

          When Stitch loads data for the `emails` table, it will reference these records in `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` to de-duplicate the data. This will ensure that only the most recent version of a record exists in the `emails` table.
        example-table: |
          <table class="attribute-list">
          <tr>
          {% for attribute in attributes %}
          <td>
          <strong>{{ attribute }}</strong>
          </td>
          {% endfor %}
          </tr>
          {% for record in primary-keys-table.example-records %}
          <tr>
          {% for attribute in attributes %}
          <td>
          {{ record[attribute] }}
          </td>
          {% endfor %}
          </tr>
          {% endfor %}
          </table>

        sub-subsections:
          - title: "Example table: Google BigQuery (v2)"
            anchor: "example-table--google-bigquery"
            content: |
              {% assign attributes = "table_name|column_name" | split:"|" %}

              In Google BigQuery (v2) destinations, the Primary Key data for the `emails` table will look like this in `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}`:

              {{ subsection.example-table | flatify }}

          - title: "Example table: Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse"
            anchor: "example-table--azure-sql-data-warehouse"
            content: |
              {% assign attributes = "table_name|column_name|ordinal_position" | split:"|" %}

              In Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations, the Primary Key data for the `emails` table will look like this in `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}`:

              {{ subsection.example-table | flatify }}

  - title: "Effects of Primary Key changes"
    anchor: "effects-of-primary-key-changes"
    summary: "The effects of Primary Key changes in the source"
    content: |
      Replication issues can arise if Primary Keys in the source change, or if data in the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` is incorrectly altered or removed.

      Along with being unable to load data, Stitch will surface the following error if this occurs:

      ```
      Primary Keys for table do not match Primary Keys of incoming data
      ```

      If you recieve this error, you should [reset the table(s)]({{ link.replication.reset-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) mentioned in the error. This will queue a full re-replication of the table, which will ensure Primary Keys are correctly captured and used to de-dupe data when loading.
