  A reserved keyword is a word that has a special meaning, and is therefore "reserved from use." Reserved keywords are also known as **reserved identifiers**.

  In this guide, we'll cover:

  {% for section in page.sections %}

  {% endfor %}

          A reserved keyword is a word that has a special meaning, and is therefore "reserved from use." Reserved keywords are also known as **reserved identifiers**.

          In Stitch, there are two types of reserved keywords:

          - **Stitch reserved keywords**, or words that are reserved to Stitch. For example: The `{{ system-column.prefix }}` prefix used in Stitch system tables and columns.
          - **Destination reserved keywords**, or words that are reserved by a destination.

      - title: "Why can't I use reserved keywords?"
        anchor: "why-cant-i-use-reserved-keywords"
        content: |
          Stitch [reserves its own keywords](#stitch-reserved-keywords) to ensure your data is loaded accurately.

          Additionally, each destination has [its own list of reserved keywords](#destination-reserved-keywords) and its own reasons for reserving those words.

      - title: "What happens to data that contains reserved keywords?"
        anchor: "data-containing-reserved-keywords"
        content: |
          If a table or column contains a reserved keyword, the destination will reject the data and create a record in the [rejected records log]({{ link.destinations.storage.rejected-records | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

  - title: "Reserved keyword reference"

      In Stitch, there are two types of keywords:

      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.title }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }}): {{ subsection.summary }}
      {% endfor %}

    subsections:
      - title: "Stitch reserved keywords"
        anchor: "stitch-reserved-keywords"
        summary: "Keywords reserved by Stitch"

          {% assign destinations = site.destinations | where:"destination",true | sort:"title" %}

          The following table provides the list of reserved keywords in Stitch, the reason, and the destination(s) the keyword applies to.

          **Note**: Keywords are **case-insensitive**. This means that `ABC`, `aBc`, `abc`, etc. are all considered the same.

          In addition to the keywords Stitch reserves, each destination also has its own list of reserved or limited keywords. For more info, including a list of reserved keywords, refer to your destination's official documentation: 

          {% for destination in destinations %}
          {% if site.data.destinations.resource-links[destination.type]reserved-words %}
          - [{{ destination.title | remove: " Destination" }}]({{ site.data.destinations.resource-links[destination.type]reserved-words }}){:target="new"}
          {% endif %}
          {% endfor %}
