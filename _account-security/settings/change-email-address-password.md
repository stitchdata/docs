  If [Single Sign-on (SSO)]({{ link.security.single-sign-on | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is enabled, only {{ site.data.stitch.user-management.roles.administrator.name | append: "s" }} will have the ability to change their email address and/or password in Stitch. All other users will need to make changes through their Identity Provider (IdP).

  Manage your user profile, email address, and password on the **Your Profile** page.

  In this guide, we'll cover:

      {% capture email-requirements %}
      An email address can only be associated with one Stitch account. If your email client supports using aliases, [you can use this workaround]({{ link.account.team-members | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#add-to-multiple-accounts" }}) to associate an email with multiple accounts.

      **Note**: If [SSO]({{ link.security.single-sign-on | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is enabled, this workaround won't work unless configured through your Identity Provider (IdP).
