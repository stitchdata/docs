  With the Stitch API, you can programmatically control your Stitch account. This enables you to quickly create and configure integrations, select tables and columns for replication, connect Stitch with an external scheduler, and more.

  In this guide, we'll cover:

  {% for section in page.sections %}
  - [{{ section.summary }}](#{{ section.anchor }})
  {% endfor %}

sections:
  - title: "API key basics"
    anchor: "api-key-basics"
    summary: "Some API key basics"
    content: |
      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.title }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})

          A Stitch API key grants the user access to your Stitch account via the API. API keys should be handled like other credentials, such as a password. Stitch will display API keys only once, immediately after they are created.

          {% include important.html type="single-line" content="**Don't share your API key!** Not even with Stitch Support. Keep it secret; keep it safe." %}

          If an API key is lost or compromised, [delete the API key in Stitch](#delete-api-key) and then [create a new one](#create-api-key).

      - title: "How many API keys can I have?"
        anchor: "maximum-api-keys"
        content: |
          A single Stitch account may have up to 10 API keys at a time. This includes API keys that are currently enabled or disabled.

      - title: "Who can create an API key?"
        anchor: "who-can-create-keys"
        content: |
          Any team member in a Stitch account that has API access can create, delete, disable, or re-enable an API key. While API keys are specific to the user who created them, all members of a Stitch account will be able to see high-level details about the API keys in use:

      - title: "What Stitch plans include API access?"
        anchor: "plans-with-api-access"
        content: |
          Only the Stitch Enterprise plan includes access to the Stitch API. 

      - title: "What happens if I downgrade to a plan without API access?"
        anchor: "plan-downgrade"
        content: |
          If you decide to downgrade to a plan without API access, your API keys will be revoked (disabled).

          If you upgrade from a plan without API access to a plan that includes it, and you previously created API keys in your account, you will need to [re-enable the API keys](#disable-reenable-api-key) to utilize the API again.
