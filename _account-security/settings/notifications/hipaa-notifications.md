    Activating this setting will not, by itself, make your Stitch account HIPAA compliant. As part of an Enterprise plan, Stitch can ensure PHI is handled in compliance with HIPAA. [Contact Stitch Sales for more info]({{ site.sales | append: page.enterprise-cta.url }}).

      The {{ app.buttons.suppress-plaintext-notifications }} setting in the **Notifications** section will do just that - suppress plain-text messages in email notifications. This setting is used in compliance with HIPAA requirements to prevent sensitive data from being sent via notifications.

      Check the {{ app.buttons.suppress-plaintext-notifications }} checkbox and click the {{ app.buttons.notification-settings }} button to enable plain-text suppressions in notification emails.
