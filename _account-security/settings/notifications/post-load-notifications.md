  In the **{{ app.page-names.notification-tab }}** tab of the **{{ app.page-names.account-settings }}** page, you can configure webhooks to fire each time data is loaded into your existing destination. Using Stitch's post-load hooks feature, you can automate your post-load processing functions.

  In this guide, we'll cover:

      Using post-load hooks, you can trigger:

      - Downstream processing in SQL
      - An [Amazon Web Services Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/){:target="new"}
      - [Talend Cloud](https://help.talend.com/reader/6SB6Qfc014RWM4mEltupHA/5SzrIShpW6sCuQXlekpBNQ){:target="new"} workflows
      - Any other system that can be controlled with an HTTP request

          If you decide to downgrade to a plan without post-load hook access, the feature will be disabled and notifications will no longer be sent to the webhook URLs in the post-load hook list.

          If you upgrade from a plan without post-load hook access to a plan that includes it, and you previously added post-load webhook URLs in your account, you will need to [re-enable them](#disable-reenable-webhook-urls) to allow Stitch to send webhooks to the webhook URLs again.

          An account's post-load hook list may have a maximum of 10 webhook URLs.

        anchor: "how-are-webhooks-sent"
        content: |
          Post-load webhooks are sent on a per-integration, per-table basis.

          For example: You're tracking two tables (`orders` and `customers`) in a Shopify integration. Stitch will send two post-load webhooks for the Shopify integration - one for the `orders` table, and one for `customers`.

      - title: "When are webhooks sent?"
        anchor: "when-are-hooks-sent"
        content: |
          A post-load hook will be sent each time data for a tracked table is successfully loaded or rejected.

          **Note**: In the event that Stitch is unable to deliver the webhook to the URL(s) in the Post-load hook list, an [email notification]({{ link.account.notification-settings | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#undeliverable-post-load" }}) will be sent.

      - title: "What services can I use with post-load hooks?"
        anchor: "what-services-post-load-hooks"
        content: |
          To be compatible with Stitch post-load hooks, the service must provide a properly formatted HTTPS webhook URL.

    summary: "How to add, disable, and delete post-load hooks in your account"
    content: |
      Any team member in a Stitch account that has access to the post-load webhook feature can create, delete, disable, or re-enable a post-load webhook URL.

      You can manage post-load webhooks in two ways:

      1. **In the Stitch app**:
         {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
         - [{{ subsection.title | remove: " in the Stitch app" }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})
         {% endfor %}
      2. [**Via the Connect API**]({{ link.connect.api | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#notifications--section" }}), if your Stitch plan includes API access.
      
    subsections:
      - title: "Add a post-load webhook URL in the Stitch app"

        content: |
          {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: An account's post-load hook list may have a maximum of 10 webhook URLs." %}

          1. Click the {{ app.menu-paths.account-settings }}.
          2. Click the **{{ app.page-names.notification-tab }}** tab.

          4. In the field that displays, paste the webhook URL.

             **Note**: [The webhook URL must use HTTPS](#what-services-post-load-hooks), otherwise you'll receive an `Invalid URI` error and be unable to save the webhook.
          5. Click the **Save Webhook** button.
