  {% include misc/data-files.html %}

  In the **{{ app.page-names.notification-tab }}** tab of the **{{ app.page-names.account-settings }}** page, you can extend Stitch's email notifications to include additional email addresses outside of the current account users.

  With the custom notification list, you can integrate services like PagerDuty, Datadog, or Slack to receive email alerts from Stitch. 

  In this guide, we'll cover:

      Using the custom notification list feature, you can:

      - **Integrate with external monitoring systems** like [PagerDuty](https://www.pagerduty.com/){:target="new"} or [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/){:target="new"}. Send Stitch email notifications to your monitoring systems to get ahead of critical issues. Check out our [PagerDuty]({{ link.account.pagerduty-notifications | prepend: site.baseurl }}) and [Datadog]({{ link.account.datadog-notifications | prepend: site.baseurl }}) integration guides for more info.
      - **Post updates to Slack**. Make sure the right people are notified when there's an issue that needs intervention by sending Stitch notifications right to a [Slack](https://slack.com){:target="new"} channel. Check out our [Slack integration guide]({{ link.account.slack-notifications | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.
      - **Trigger other apps** using [Zapier](https://zapier.com){:target="new"}.

      For details about the email notifications Stitch sends, refer to the [Notification reference]({{ link.account.notification-reference | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This info can be used to create different alerts for individual notification types.

      For example: Your team wants to be notified when their Stitch account is nearing its row limit. Based on this, you can filter emails from Stitch with the subject [`Approaching Row Limit`]({{ link.account.notification-settings | prepend: site.baseurl }}#usage-nearing-limit), which are sent when an account is nearing its usage limit.

    content: |
      The custom notification list feature is available during the Free Trial or on an Enterprise plan. Contact [Stitch Sales]({{ site.sales }}){:target="new"} for more info about Enterprise plans.

        anchor: "plan-downgrades"
        content: |
          If you decide to downgrade to a plan without custom notification list access, the feature will be disabled and notifications will no longer be sent to the email addresses in the custom notifications list.

          If you upgrade from a plan without custom notification list access to a plan that includes it, and you previously added custom notification email addresses in your account, you will need to [re-enable them](#disable-reenable-email-addresses) to allow Stitch to send notifications to the email address again.

          Any email notification that is sent to other team members of the account will also be sent to any custom notification recipient with an **Enabled** status.

          The only exception is the monthly invoice email. This will only be sent to [the user of the account who originally entered the account's payment information]({{ link.account.team-members | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#who-will-receive-invoices" }}).
