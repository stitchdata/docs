    items:
      - question: "How does Stitch billing work?"
        anchor: "stitch-billing"
        answer: |
          Plans are based on the volume of rows and events replicated per month. Each plan has a monthly allotment of replicated rows.

          In addition, access to some integrations depends on the type of plan you select. Refer to the [pricing page]({{ site.pricing }}){:target="new"} for more info.

  - topic: "Integrations"
    anchor: "integrations"
    items:
      - question: "How many integrations can I add in my Stitch account?"
        anchor: "how-many-integrations-can-i-add"
        answer: |
          {% include misc/icons.html %}
          The total number of integrations refers to the number of distinct integration types each account may add, dependent upon the selected plan type.

          {% assign standard-plan = site.data.stitch.subscription-plans.standard %}

          For example: Accounts using the Standard Plan may add up to **{{ standard-plan.total-integrations | downcase }}** different types of integrations.

          If an account has **five** Google Analytics integrations connected, this only counts as **one** towards the integration type quota. Up to **nine** additional types of integrations may still be added.

          <table class="attribute-list">
          <tr>
          <td class="attribute-name">
          <strong>Plan name</strong>
          </td>
          <td>
          <strong>Number of sources</strong>
          </td>
          </tr>
          {% for plan in site.data.stitch.subscription-plans.all-plans %}
          {% if plan.key %}
          {% assign this-plan = site.data.stitch.subscription-plans[plan.key] %}
          {% else %}
          {% assign this-plan = site.data.stitch.subscription-plans[plan.name] %}
          {% endif %}
          <tr>
          <td class="attribute-name">
          <strong>{{ plan.name | capitalize | replace:"-", " " }}</strong>
          </td>
          <td>
          {{ this-plan.total-integrations }}

          </tr>
          {% endfor %}
          </table>
          <br>

          **Note**: The types of integrations available are also dependent on plan type. Users of the {{ site.data.stitch.subscription-plans.advanced.name }} and {{ site.data.stitch.subscription-plans.premium.name }} plans will have access to all integrations, while Standard Plan users will have access only to Standard integrations.

          For more info, refer to the [pricing page]({{ site.pricing }}){:target="new"}.

      - question: "What integrations are available on a Standard Plan?"
        anchor: "integrations-paid-plan"
        answer: |
          After the Free Trial has ended, only Standard integrations will be available to users who select a Standard plan. This includes the majority of Stitch's available integrations with the exception of those offered as part of an [{{ site.data.stitch.subscription-plans.advanced.name }} or {{ site.data.stitch.subscription-plans.premium.name }} plan]({{ link.account.enterprise-features | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

#   HISTORICAL DATA LOADS    #
# -------------------------- #

  - topic: "Historical data loads"
    anchor: "historical-data-loads"
    items:
      - question: "What is a free historical data load?"
        anchor: "free-historical-data-load"
        answer: |
          During the first seven days after a new integration begins to replicate data, replication is free. This is a free historical data load, and means that rows replicated from the new integration during this time won't count towards your quota. This is applicable to all integrations, regardless of plan type.

          After the seven days are over, Stitch will continue to replicate data from the integration. Be sure to **pause** or **delete** the integration if you are no longer interested in replicating its data.

          Free historical data loads are only allowed once per integration namespace. For example: If an integration named `stitch_hubspot` is created and receives a free historical data load, subsequent integrations with the same name (created by deleting and creating a new integration) will not receive free historical replication.

      - question: "Do free historical data loads apply to integration or table resets?"
        anchor: "free-historical-loads-resets"
        answer: |
          If the reset occurs during the free historical data load period, yes.

          If the reset occurs after the free historical data load period has ended, no.

          Free historical data loads are only applicable to new integrations for the first seven days after they begin to replicate data. [Resetting replication]({{ link.replication.reset-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for an integration or a table will count towards your quota.

      - question: "When do the seven days of historical data loading begin?"
        anchor: "free-historical-data-load-begin"
        answer: |
          The free historical data load period for new integrations begins after the integration first replicates data.

          For example: You create an integration on June 1 but don't fully configure it until June 2. In this case, the free historical data load will begin on June 2 and end June 9.

          **Note**: This is applicable only to integrations created on or after May 22, 2018.

#          ROW COUNTS        #
# -------------------------- #

  - topic: "Row counts"
    anchor: "row-usage"
    items:
      - question: "Where can I view my usage?"
        anchor: "view-billing-usage"
        answer: |
          {% include billing/view-usage.html %}

      - question: "Why do I see 'free' rows in my usage?"
        anchor: "free-row-usage"
        answer: |
          Free rows might display on your Stitch dashboard for a handful of reasons:

          - A new integration's [free historical data load](#historical-data-loads)
          - An exemption for beta testing an integration
          - Re-replicating data due to a defect

      - question: "When will my row count will reset?"
        anchor: "when-will-row-count-reset"
        answer: |
          You can find your Reset Date in the **Plan Details** section of the {{ app.page-names.billing }} page, accessed by clicking the {{ app.menu-paths.billing }}.

      - question: "How can I reduce my row usage?"
        anchor: "reduce-row-usage"
        answer: |
          We recommend [following the simple tips in this guide]({{ link.getting-started.row-usage | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#reducing-your-usage" }}) to reduce your row usage.

      - question: "What happens if I use more than the rows allotted in my plan?"
        anchor: "exceed-row-allotment"
        answer: |
          We never want you to lose access to fresh data. So instead of shutting down your data pipeline once you hit your monthly row limit, we will let you know as you approach your limit and youâ€™ll be able to reduce frequency of updates, pause integrations, or upgrade your plan. Plan upgrades happen immediately and you will be charged only for the time remaining in your billing cycle.

#    CHOOSE & CHANGE PLANS   #
# -------------------------- #

  - topic: "Choose and change plans"
    anchor: "manage-plans"
    items: 
      - question: "Do I have to select a plan after my Free Trial ends?"
        anchor: "select-plan-after-free-trial"
        answer: |
          Yes. When your trial ends, Stitch will automatically pause your integrations. Replication will resume after you select a plan and enter a valid credit card.

      - question: "How can I change my plan?"
        anchor: "change-plan"
        answer: |
          You can change your plan in the **Plan Details** section of the {{ app.page-names.billing }} page, accessed by clicking {{ app.menu-paths.billing }}.

          Click the **Change Your Plan** button and select the plan you want from the window that displays.

      - question: "What happens if I change my plan mid-billing cycle?"
        anchor: "change-plan-mid-cycle"
        answer: |
          This depends on the billing cycle type for the plan.
          
          **For monthly plans**:

          If you're upgrading or downgrading a monthly plan, meaning the new plan has a greater or lower row limit than the current plan, the change will be effective immediately and you will be charged or refunded the difference between the current plan and the new plan.

          In addition, if you're upgrading to a plan that has access to additional features, you'll have immediate access to those features. 
             
          **For annual plans**:

          - **If you're upgrading**, meaning the new plan has a greater row limit than the current plan, the change will be effective immediately and you will be charged the difference between the current plan and the new plan.

          - **If you're downgrading**, meaning the new plan has a lower row limit than the current plan, the change will take effect at the end of the billing cycle. This ensures that you can take full advantage of the higher row allotment for the remainder of the billing cycle.

# PAYMENT DETAILS & INVOICES #

  - topic: "Manage payment details and invoices"
    anchor: "payment-invoices"
    items:
      - question: "Where do I manage my payment details?"
        anchor: "manage-payment-details"
        answer: |
          {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: Until contact addresses are updated, the user who initially enters the payment info will receive your account's monthly invoice in their email." %}

          You can enter and manage your credit card, addresses and contact details in the {{ app.page-names.billing }} page, accessed by clicking {{ app.menu-paths.billing }}.

          When you enter the cardholder's name, **make sure that a valid last name is entered**. Though Stitch does validate these fields, we've seen replication issues arise when the Last Name field is blank.  

      - question: "What types of payment does Stitch accept?"
        anchor: "accepted-payment-types"
        answer: |
          Stitch accepts all major credit cards. Additional options are available for Enterprise and Unlimited customers.

      - question: "Where can I see my past payments?"
        anchor: "view-past-payments"
        answer: |
          You can view your past payments, including the payment amount and associated invoice number, in the **Past Payments** section of the {{ app.page-names.billing }} page.

      - question: "Can I change my billing address?"
        anchor: "change-bill-to-address"
        answer: |
          When a user subscribes to a paid plan, the "Bill to" address is overwritten by the "Sold to" address because a billing address is required. 

          To change either of these addresses, head to the {{ app.page-names.billing }} page, accessed by clicking {{ app.menu-paths.billing }}.

          Please note that a "Sold to" address can only be updated when changing payment methods. When the "Sold to" address is updated, Stitch will begin to charge the appropriate sales tax in the next invoice.

      - question: "Who receives a copy of the monthly invoice?"
        anchor: "copy-monthly-invoice"
        answer: |
          The user who initially adds the payment information to the account, and any user-provided email addresses, will receive a copy of the monthly invoice in their email. Additionally, everyone can also view the Past Payments details in the {{ app.page-names.billing }} page.

          There is a hard limit of 38 additional email addresses per account. These emails are not restricted to just Stitch users. Any email address added will begin receiving invoices as soon as the next invoice is issued.
