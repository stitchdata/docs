# I'm pretty sure most of the bg is around GDPR and unlocking customers who can't/won't have their data move through the US. Another benefit would be performance - moving data over an ocean is expensive and slow

          When you create a Stitch account, you'll need to define a data pipeline region. This setting defines the region where Stitch-hosted data centers will process your data.

          Stitch uses Amazon Web Services (AWS) to host and run its infrastructure. Each Stitch data pipeline region corresponds to an AWS region.

          For example: If `{{ north-america-region.name }}` is selected as the region in Stitch, Stitch's data centers in AWS' `{{ north-america-region.aws-name }} ({{ north-america-region.region }})` region will be used to process data.

          Now that you understand how the data pipeline region affects your Stitch account, we'll clarify what "data processing" means in the context of regions.

          Data pipeline regions only affect the replication of data in your Stitch account, specifically extracting, preparing, and loading data into your destination.

          All other processes and data, such as billing, reporting, and other metadata, are not affected by your account's data pipeline region. Metadata related to these processes will be processed using Stitch's `{{ north-america-region.name }}` region.

          Before selecting a data pipeline region for your account, consider the following:

          - **The distance between your location and the data pipeline region.** We recommend, whenever possible, using the region closest to your location.
          - **The destination you want to use.** Some destinations aren't available in all regions, though we hope to expand data pipeline region support in the future. Refer to the [Data pipeline region support by destination type](#region-support-by-destination) section for more info.
          - **Any data processing regulations that your country and/or company might have in place.** Keeping your data within your own region may make it easier to comply with these requirements.

          Data pipeline regions are selected during the account creation process. Regions can't be changed after the account is created.

          Data pipeline regions can't be changed after your Stitch account is created. If you want to change your region, you'll need to create a new Stitch account and select the desired region.
