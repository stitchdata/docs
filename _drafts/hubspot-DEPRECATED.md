{% contentfor setup %}
Connecting your HubSpot data to Stitch is a four-step process:

1. [Locate your HubSpot portal ID](#locate-hubspot-portal-id)
2. [Add HubSpot as a Stitch data source](#add-stitch-data-source)
3. [Define the Replication Frequency](#define-rep-frequency)
4. [Authorize Stitch to access HubSpot](#grant-stitch-authorization)

### Prerequisites
**You'll need Admin permissions to complete the setup.** This will ensure that Stitch is able to access and replicate all the data in your HubSpot account.

### Locating Your HubSpot Portal ID {#locate-hubspot-portal-id}
A portal ID is a unique identifier HubSpot uses to differentiate accounts, or ‘portals.’ You can find your ID by looking in the top-right corner when you're signed into your HubSpot account:

![Locating your HubSpot portal ID.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/integrations/hubspot-portal-id.png)

After you've located your portal ID, you can move onto connecting HubSpot to Stitch.

{% include custom/integrations/setup/connection-setup.html %}
4. In the **HubSpot Portal ID** field, enter the portal ID of the account you want to connect to Stitch.

{% include custom/integrations/setup/replication-frequency.html %}

### Authorizing Stitch to Access HubSpot {#grant-stitch-authorization}

1. Next, you'll be prompted to sign into your HubSpot account if you aren't already.
2. A screen asking for authorization to HubSpot will display after you sign in. **Note that we will only ever read your data**. Stitch will never modify or delete any data in your HubSpot account. 
3. Click **Authorize.**
4. After the authorization process is successfully completed, you'll be directed back to Stitch.
5. Click {{ app.buttons.finish-int-setup }}.
