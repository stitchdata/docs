  This guide serves as a reference for version {{ destination.this-version }} of Stitch's {{ destination.display_name }} destination.

        content: |
          When you set up a {{ destination.display_name }} destination, you'll select a Google Storage location. This determines the location of the internal Google Storage bucket Stitch uses during the replication process.

          Stitch supports the following Google Cloud Storage regions for version {{ destination.this-version }} of the {{ destination.display_name }} destination:

          {% include destinations/templates/bigquery-supported-regions-table.html %}

      - title: "Google BigQuery pricing"
        anchor: "pricing"
        content: |
          Unlike many other cloud-based data warehouse solutions, {{ destination.display_name }}'s pricing model is based on **usage** and not a fixed-rate. This means that your bill can vary over time. 

          Before fully committing yourself to using {{ destination.display_name }} as your data warehouse, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the {{ destination.display_name }} pricing model and how using Stitch may impact your costs.

  - title: "Replication"
    anchor: "replication"
    content: |
      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.title }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}

    subsections:
      - title: "Loading behavior"
        anchor: "loading-behavior"
        content: |
          Stitch will use Append-Only replication when loading data into this version of the {{ destination.display_name }} destination.

          In Append-Only replication, existing rows aren't updated. Multiple versions of a row can exist in a table, creating a log of how a row changed over time. **Note**: While this may look like a discrepancy, it is intended functionality for {{ destination.display_name }} {{ destination.this-version | prepend: "v" }} destinations.

          Because of this loading strategy, querying may require [a different strategy than usual]({{ link.replication.append-only | prepend: site.baseurl }}). Using some of the system columns Stitch inserts into tables will enable you to locate the latest version of a record at query time.

          Refer to the [Understanding loading behavior guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.

      - title: "Primary Keys"
        anchor: "replication--primary-keys"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} destinations don't have native support for Primary Keys. While Primary Key columns will be present in destination tables, no constraints will be applied to the columns.

      - title: "Incompatible sources"
        anchor: "replication--incompatible-sources"
        content: |
          {% include shared/incompatibilities/destination-version-incompatibilities.html %}

  - title: "Transformations"
    anchor: "transformations"
    content: |
      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.title }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}

    subsections:
      - title: "System tables and columns"
        anchor: "transformations--system-tables-columns"
        content: |
          Stitch will create the following tables in each integration's dataset:

          - [{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-rejected.name }}]({{ link.destinations.storage.rejected-records | prepend: site.baseurl }})

          Additionally, Stitch will insert [system columns]({{ link.destinations.storage.system-tables-and-columns | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (prepended with `{{ system-column.prefix }}`) into each table.

# Refer to the [Data typing documentation]({{ link.getting-started.basic-concepts | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#data-typing" }}) for more info.
      - title: "Data typing"
        anchor: "transformations--data-typing"
        content: |
          Stitch converts data types only where needed to ensure the data is accepted by {{ destination.display_name }}. In the table below are the data types Stitch supports for {{ destination.display_name }} destinations, and the Stitch types they map to.

          {% include replication/templates/data-types/destination-data-types.html display-intro=true %}

      - title: "JSON structures"
        anchor: "transformations--json-structures"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} supports nested records within tables, whether it's a single record or repeated values. This means that when nested data structures are loaded into {{ destination.display_name }}, they will be maintained.

      - title: "Column names"
        anchor: "transformations--column-naming"
        content: |
          Column names in {{ destination.display_name }}:

          {{ site.data.destinations.bigquery.destination-details.column-name-rules | flatify | markdownify }}

          Stitch will perform the following transformations to ensure column names [adhere to the rules imposed by {{ destination.display_name }}](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/schemas#column_names){:target="new"}:

          {% include destinations/templates/destination-column-name-transformations.html %}

      - title: "Timezones"
        anchor: "transformations--timezones"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} will store the value in UTC as `TIMESTAMP`.

          More info about timestamp data types can be found in [BigQuery's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#timestamp-type){:target="new"}.

  - title: "Compare destinations"
    anchor: "compare-destinations"
    content: |
