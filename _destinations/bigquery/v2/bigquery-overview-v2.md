  This guide serves as a reference for version {{ destination.this-version }} of Stitch's {{ destination.display_name }} destination.

        content: |
          When you set up a {{ destination.display_name }} destination, you'll select a Google Storage location. This determines the location of the internal Google Storage bucket Stitch uses during the replication process.

          Stitch supports the following Google Cloud Storage regions for version {{ destination.this-version }} of the {{ destination.display_name }} destination:

      - title: "Google BigQuery pricing"
        anchor: "pricing"
        content: |
          Unlike many other cloud-based data warehouse solutions, {{ destination.display_name }}'s pricing model is based on **usage** and not a fixed-rate. This means that your bill can vary over time. 

          Before fully committing yourself to using {{ destination.display_name }} as your data warehouse, we recommend familiarizing yourself with the {{ destination.display_name }} pricing model and how using Stitch may impact your costs.

            content: |
              {% include replication/replication-process-phases.html phase="data-extraction" %}

          - title: "Step 3: Google Cloud Storage bucket"
            anchor: "replication--gcs-bucket"
            content: |
              Stitch loads the data into a Stitch-owned Google Cloud Storage (GCS) bucket in the [region you select during destination setup](#supported-gcs-regions).

          - title: "Step 4: BigQuery staging tables"
            anchor: "replication--bigquery-staging-tables"
            content: |
              Using the IAM service account you provide during destination setup, data is read and transferred from the GCS bucket to staging tables in {{ destination.display_name }}. Staging tables from previous loads are deleted before the new load begins.

          - title: "Step 5: Data merge"
            anchor: "replication--data-merge"
            content: |
              Data is merged from the staging tables into datasets in {{ destination.display_name }}.

              The [loading behavior you select during setup](#loading-behavior) determines not only what the data looks like in the destination, but the method Stitch uses to load it. **Note**: The loading behavior can also affect your [{{ destination.display_name }} costs]({{ link.destinations.overviews.bigquery-pricing | prepend: site.baseurl | append:"#bigquery-query-pricing" }}).

              Once completed, the data is deleted from Stitch's internal GCS bucket.

      - title: "Loading behavior"
        anchor: "loading-behavior"
        content: |
          How data is loaded into {{ destination.display_name }} depends on the **Loading behavior** setting you define during destination setup:

          - **Upsert**: Existing rows are updated in tables with defined Primary Keys. A single version of a row will exist in the table.

          - **Append-Only**: Existing rows aren't updated. Multiple versions of a row can exist in a table, creating a log of how a row changed over time.

             Because of this loading strategy, [querying may require a different strategy]({{ link.replication.append-only | prepend: site.baseurl }}) than usual. Using some of the system columns Stitch inserts into tables will enable you to locate the latest version of a record at query time.

          Refer to the [Understanding loading behavior guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.

          **Note**: Loading behavior can impact your [{{ destination.display_name }} costs]({{ link.destinations.overviews.bigquery-pricing | prepend: site.baseurl | append:"#bigquery-query-pricing" }}).

      - title: "Primary Keys"
        anchor: "replication--primary-keys"
        content: |
          Stitch requires Primary Keys to de-dupe incrementally replicated data. To ensure Primary Key data is available, Stitch creates an `{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-primary-keys.name }}`table in every integration dataset. This table contains a list of all tables in an integration's dataset and the columns those tables use as Primary Keys.

          Refer to the [{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-primary-keys.name }} table documentation]({{ link.destinations.storage.primary-key-system-table | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.

          **Note**: Removing or altering this table can lead to replication issues.

      - title: "Incompatible sources"
        anchor: "replication--incompatible-sources"
        content: |
          {% include shared/incompatibilities/destination-version-incompatibilities.html %}

  - title: "Transformations"
    anchor: "transformations"
    content: |
      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.title }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}

    subsections:
      - title: "System tables and columns"
        anchor: "transformations--system-tables-columns"
        content: |
          Stitch will create the following tables in each integration's dataset:

          - [{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-primary-keys.name }}]({{ link.destinations.storage.primary-key-system-table | prepend: site.baseurl }})
          - [{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-rejected.name }}]({{ link.destinations.storage.rejected-records | prepend: site.baseurl }})

          Additionally, Stitch will insert [system columns]({{ link.destinations.storage.system-tables-and-columns | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (prepended with `{{ system-column.prefix }}`) into each table.

# Refer to the [Data typing documentation]({{ link.getting-started.basic-concepts | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#data-typing" }}) for more info.
      - title: "Data typing"
        anchor: "transformations--data-typing"
        content: |
          Stitch converts data types only where needed to ensure the data is accepted by {{ destination.display_name }}. In the table below are the data types Stitch supports for {{ destination.display_name }} destinations, and the Stitch types they map to.

          {% include replication/templates/data-types/destination-data-types.html display-intro=true %}

      - title: "JSON structures"
        anchor: "transformations--json-structures"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} supports nested records within tables, whether it's a single record or repeated values. Refer to the [{{ destination.display_name }} and Storing Nested Data Structures documentation]({{ link.destinations.storage.bigquery-nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.

      - title: "Column names"
        anchor: "transformations--column-naming"
        content: |
          Column names in {{ destination.display_name }}:

          {{ site.data.destinations.bigquery.destination-details.column-name-rules | flatify | markdownify }}

          Stitch will perform the following transformations to ensure column names [adhere to the rules imposed by {{ destination.display_name }}](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/schemas#column_names){:target="new"}:

          {% include destinations/templates/destination-column-name-transformations.html %}

      - title: "Timezones"
        anchor: "transformations--timezones"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} will store the value in UTC as `TIMESTAMP`.

          More info about timestamp data types can be found in [BigQuery's documentation](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/reference/standard-sql/data-types#timestamp-type){:target="new"}.

    anchor: "compare-destinations"
