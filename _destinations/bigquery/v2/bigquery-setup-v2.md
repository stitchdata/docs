  **{{ destination.display_name }} v1 migration**: If migrating from {{ destination.display_name }} v1, there are additional steps that must be completed. Refer to the [Migrating from {{ destination.display_name }} v1 guide]({{ link.destinations.setup.bigquery-v1-migration | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for instructions.

#        Requirements        #
# -------------------------- #

requirements:
  - item: |
      **An existing Google Cloud Platform (GCP) project with the following setup:**

      - **Enabled billing for the GCP project**. The project must have [billing enabled and an attached credit card]({{ site.data.destinations.bigquery.resource-links.enable-billing }}). This is required for Stitch to successfully load data.

      - **An existing {{ destination.display_name }} instance in the GCP project.** Stitch will not create an instance for you.

  - item: |
      **Permissions in the GCP project that allow you to create Identity Access Management (IAM) service accounts.** Stitch uses a service account during the replication process to load data into {{ destination.display_name }}. Refer to [Google's documentation]({{ site.data.destinations.bigquery.resource-links.service-accounts }}){:target="new"} for more info about service accounts and the permissions required to create them.
