summary: "After your data is replicated, you'll need a place to store it. Stitch supports some of the most popular databases currently available for use as data warehouses. We call them destinations, but the purpose is the same: a central repository for all your data."

    As part of an Enterprise plan, you can configure Stitch to route different data sources to different destinations based on your needs. [Contact Stitch Sales for more info]({{ site.sales | append: page.enterprise-cta.url }}).

intro: |
  When Stitch replicates your data, it'll load it into the destination - or data warehouse - of your choosing. A data warehouse is a central repository of integrated data from disparate sources.

  It's important to note that Stitch itself is **not** a data warehouse. Stitch is a data pipeline (or ETL tool) that enables you to replicate data from various sources and consolidate it into a single location. **A destination is required to use Stitch.**

      If you're new to data warehousing or want to see how Stitch's destination offerings compare to each other, look no further.

      The [Choosing a Destination]({{ link.destinations.overviews.choose-destination | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide can help you choose the best Stitch destination for your data warehousing needs, from ensuring your data sources are compatible to staying within your budget.

      In addition, the [Data Strategy Guide]({{ site.data-strategy }}) is a great place to start if you want some guidance on analytical versus transactional databases.

      Stitch currently allows you to connect **one destination per account**. In addition, data will not begin replicating until you've successfully connected a destination and at least one integration.

      Sometimes, you may want to replicate data to a different location than what you initially connected to Stitch. Whether you're simply switching to a new database or trying a different destination entirely, [you can easily change your destination in Stitch]({{ link.destinations.switch-destinations | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
