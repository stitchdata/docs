The email address you used to sign into Stitch will be used to create your Panoply data warehouse.

Additionally, Stitch is in no way involved with the management of Panoply data warehouses. If you have billing questions or need help regarding your Panoply data warehouse, [reach out to Panoply]({{ destination.main-site }}){:target="new"}.

## Spin Up a Panoply Destination {#spin-up-panoply}

1. Click the {{ app.menu-paths.destination-settings }}.
2. Click the **Panoply.io** icon.
3. A page explaining what’s included in a Panoply account will display. Click the **Create an Account** button.
4. Click the **Create My Account** button when a pop-up explaining the use of your email address displays.
5. It may take a few minutes, but after your Panoply data warehouse is successfully created, the Panoply connection info will display in Stitch:
   ![Panoply connection information.]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/panoply-connection-info.png)
6. Make sure to copy your password as Stitch won’t display it again.
7. After you’ve copied your password, click the **View Your Dashboard** button to wrap things up.

The Panoply data warehouse connection settings will automatically populate in the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page. If you need to update the settings at any point, click the {{ app.menu-paths.destination-settings }}.
