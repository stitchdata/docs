summary: &summary "Amazon Redshift is a fully managed, cloud-based data warehouse. As Redshift is built for online analytic processing and business intelligence applications, it excels at executing large-scale analytical queries. For this reason, it exhibits far better performance than traditional, row-based relational databases like MySQL and PostgreSQL."

      Currently, {{ destination.display_name}} bases their pricing on an hourly rate that varies depending on the type and number of nodes in a cluster. Check out their [Pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/redshift/pricing/) for an in-depth look at their current plan offerings.

      **So, what's a node?** A node is a single computer that participates in a cluster. Your Redshift cluster can have one to many nodes; the more nodes, the more data it can store and the faster it can process queries. Amazon currently offers four different types of nodes, each of which has its own CPU, RAM, storage capacity, and storage drive type.

      The type and number of node(s) you choose when creating your cluster is dependent on your needs and dataset. **We do, however, recommend you set up a multi-node configuration to provide data redundancy.** 

      For some guidance on choosing the right number of nodes for your cluster, check out Amazon's [Determining the Number of Nodes guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/mgmt/working-with-clusters.html#how-many-nodes).
