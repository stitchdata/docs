requirements:
  - item: |
      **An Amazon Web Services (AWS) account.** Signing up is free - [click here](https://aws.amazon.com){:target="new"} or go to `https://aws.amazon.com` to create an account if you don't have one already.
  - item: |
      **Permissions to create and manage S3 buckets in AWS**. Your AWS user must be able to create a bucket (if one doesn't already exist), add/modify bucket policies, and upload files to the bucket.
  - item: |
      **An up and running Amazon S3 bucket**. Instructions for creating a bucket using the AWS console are in [Step 1 of this guide](#create-a-bucket).


# -------------------------- #
#         Instructions       #
# -------------------------- #

steps:
  - title: "Create an {{ destination.display_name }} bucket"
    anchor: "create-a-bucket"
    content: |
      {% include note.html type="single-line" content="Skip to [Step 2](#configure-stitch-settings) if there is an existing S3 bucket you want to connect to Stitch." %}

      {% include layout/inline_image.html type="right" file="destinations/amazon-s3-create-bucket-1.png" max-width="400px" alt="Adding an Amazon S3 bucket policy in the AWS console" %}

      1. Sign into AWS.
      2. Click **Services** near the top-left corner of the page.
      3. Under the **Storage** option, click **S3**. A page listing all buckets currently in use will display.
      4. Click the **+ Create Bucket** button.
      5. On the first screen, **Name and region**, complete the following:
         - **Bucket name**: Enter a DNS-compliant name for the bucket.
         - **Region**: Select the region you want the bucket to be located in.

      6. When finished, click **Next**.
      7. As Stitch doesn't require any particular configuration, how you define the settings in the **Set properties** and **Set permissions** screens are up to you. Follow the on-screen prompts to complete these steps.
      8. When you reach the **Review** screen, verify that all the bucket's information and settings are correct.
      9. When ready, click **Create bucket**.


  - title: "Define the bucket settings in Stitch"
    anchor: "configure-stitch-settings"
    content: ""
    substeps:
      - title: "Define the bucket name and data storage format"
        anchor: "define-bucket-name-and-data-storage-format"
        content: |
          {% include shared/database-connection-settings.html type="general" %}

      - title: "Define S3 Object Key"
        anchor: "define-s3-object-key"
        content: |
          In {{ destination.display_name }}, [Object Keys](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/UsingMetadata.html#object-keys) are used to uniquely identify objects in a given bucket.

          The **Object Key** setting in Stitch determines the convention used to create Object Keys when Stitch writes to your bucket. For example: If the default Key is used:

          ```shell
          {{ site.data.ui.destination-settings.amazon-s3.object-keys.default }}
          ```

          This could create an object with an Object Key of:

          ```shell
          {{ site.data.ui.destination-settings.amazon-s3.object-keys.example-1 }}
          ```

          You can opt to use the default Key, which is pre-populated, or define your own using the elements in the next section.

          #### S3 Key Elements {#s3-key-elements}

          The following elements are available to construct an S3 Key:

          {% assign all-object-key-elements = site.data.ui.destination-settings.amazon-s3.object-keys.elements %}

          <table class="attribute-list">
          <tr>
          <td width="50%; fixed">
          <strong>Required Elements</strong>
          </td>
          <td>
          <strong>Optional Elements</strong>
          </td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
          <td>
          All of the following elements must be included in the S3 Key, in any order:
          <ul>
          {% for element in all-object-key-elements %}
          {% if element.required == true %}
          <li><code>[{{ element.name }}]</code>{{ element.description | strip_newlines }}</li>
          {% endif %}
          {% endfor %}
          </ul>
          </td>
          <td>
          The following elements are optional:
          <ul>
          {% for element in all-object-key-elements %}
          {% if element.required == false %}
          <li><code>[{{ element.name }}]</code></li>
          {% endif %}
          {% endfor %}
          </ul>
          </td>
          </tr>
          </table>

          Additionally, keep in mind that Keys cannot exceed **500 characters** or include spaces or special characters (`!@#$%^&*`).

          As you update the values in the **S3 Key** field, Stitch will validate the entry. If the Key doesn't include all required elements or contains spaces or special characters, you will be prompted to make corrections.

          After you've finished defining the Key, click **Continue**.

  - title: "Grant and verify bucket access"
    anchor: "grant-verify-bucket-access"
    content: |
      {% include important.html type="single-line" content="The bucket policy and challenge file name Stitch displays will only display once. Ensure you save them before moving on from this page." %}

      Next, Stitch will display a **Grant & Verify Access** page. This page contains the info you need to configure bucket access for Stitch, which is accomplished via a bucket policy. [A bucket policy](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/access-policy-language-overview.html) is JSON-based access policy language to manage permissions to bucket resources.

      **Note**: The policy Stitch provides is an auto-generated policy unique to the specific bucket you entered in the setup page. It allows Stitch to assume a role and access the bucket. An example might look like this:

      ```json
      {
        "Version": "2012-10-17",
        "Id": "",
        "Statement": [
          {
            "Sid": "",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Principal": {
              "AWS": [
                "arn:aws:iam::218546966473:role/LoaderS3"
              ]
            },
            "Action": [
              "s3:PutObject",
              "s3:GetObject",
              "s3:ListBucket"
            ],
            "Resource": [
              "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME>",
              "arn:aws:s3:::<YOUR_S3_BUCKET_NAME>/*"
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
      ```

    substeps:
      - title: "Add the Stitch bucket policy"
        anchor: "add-bucket-policy"
        content: |
          To allow Stitch to access the bucket, you'll need to add a bucket policy using the AWS console. Follow the instructions in the tab below to add the bucket policy.

          {% include destinations/templates/destination-user-setup.html %}

      - title: "Verify bucket access"
        anchor: "verify-bucket-access"
        content: |
          Next, to ensure that Stitch can access the bucket, you'll create a blank file that Stitch will use to test the permissions settings.

          1. In Stitch, just below the bucket policy code, is the **Verify your bucket** section. In this section is a field containing the unique name of the test file you need to create:

             ![Amazon S3 challenge file field in Stitch]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/amazon-s3-challenge-file-field.png)

             **Note**: This file name will only display once. If you navigate out of this screen without saving the file name, you'll need to start over.

          2. Create a blank file using the name displayed in this field. **Do not save the file with an extension (file type)** like `.csv` or `.txt`. In the image below, notice that there isn't any kind of file extension after the challenge file name:

             ![Saving the Amazon S3 challenge file without a file extension]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/amazon-s3-challenge-file-creation.png)

          3. Switch back to the AWS console and click the **Overview** tab.
          4. Click the **Upload** button and follow the prompts to upload the file.
          5. After the file has been uploaded to the bucket, switch back to where you have Stitch open.
          6. Click **Check and Save** to save and test the connection to {{ destination.display_name }}.

          {% capture challenge-file-notice %}
          The challenge file must remain in the bucket even after the initial setup. If the file isn't created, or is removed at any point after the setup, you'll receive this error: `An error occurred (404) when calling the HeadObject operation: Not Found`

          For troubleshooting, refer to the [Destination Connection Errors guide]({{ link.troubleshooting.dw-connection-errors | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
          {% endcapture %}

          {% include important.html first-line="**The challenge file must remain in your S3 bucket**" content=challenge-file-notice %}
