summary: "Microsoft Azure SQL Data Warehouses don't have native support for Primary Keys. To ensure data can be de-duped during loading, Stitch will create a Primary Keys table for each integration schema."

## The info about the _sdc_primary_keys table is kept in _data/stitch/sdc-primary-keys.yml.
## This includes the table's description, its list of attributes and their descriptions, etc.

      Because Azure SQL Data Warehouse destinations donâ€™t have native support for Primary Keys, Stitch uses the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table to store Primary Key information and de-dupe data during loading incrementally-replicated tables.
    subsections:
      - title: "Replication Methods and de-duping data"
        anchor: "replication-methods-de-duping"
        content: |
          De-duplicating data only applies to tables using an [Incremental Replication Method]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This ensures that only the most recent version of a record is loaded into the table.

          Tables using [Full Table Replication]() are not de-duped, but loaded in full during each replication job.

  - title: "Determining Primary Keys"
    anchor: "determining-primary-keys"
    content: |
      Depending on the data source type, Primary Keys are determined in one of two ways:

      - For **database integrations**, Primary Keys are defined by you in the source database. This will usually be columns with a Primary Key constrant or some other equivalent, depending on the type of database being used.

         **Note**: For [database views]({{ link.replication.db-views | prepend: site.baseurl }}) you set to replicate in Stitch, the Primary Key will be the field you define for the view during setup.
      - For **SaaS integrations**, Primary Keys are pre-defined by Stitch. Refer to the [schema documentation for your SaaS integration]({{ link.integrations.saas | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for info on the Primary Keys Stitch uses for specific tables.

      In every schema created by a Stitch integration will be a `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table. The Primary Key data for every table set to replicate will be stored in this table.

  - title: "Primary Keys table schema"
    anchor: "table-schema"
    content: |
      The `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` table contains the following columns:

      <table class="attribute-list">
      <tr>
      <td class="attribute-name">
      <strong>Column name</strong>
      </td>
      <td class="attribute-description">
      <strong>Description</strong>
      </td>
      </tr>
      {% for attribute in primary-keys-table.attributes %}
      <tr>
      <td class="attribute-name">
      <strong>{{ attribute.name }}</strong>
      </td>
      <td class="attribute-description">
      {{ attribute.description | flatify | markdownify }}
      </td>
      </tr>
      {% endfor %}
      </table>

    subsections:
      - title: "Example table"
        anchor: "example-table"
        content: |
          {{ primary-keys-table.example-records-description | flatify | markdownify }}

          <table class="attribute-list">
          <tr>
          {% for attribute in primary-keys-table.attributes %}
          <td class="attribute-description">
          <strong>{{ attribute.name }}</strong>
          </td>
          {% endfor %}
          </tr>
          {% for record in primary-keys-table.example-records %}
          <tr>
          <td class="attribute-description">
          {{ record.table-name }}
          </td>

          <td class="attribute-description">
          {{ record.column-name }}
          </td>

          <td class="attribute-description">
          {{ record.ordinal-position }}
          </td>
          </tr>
          {% endfor %}
          </table>

          When Stitch loads data for the `emails` table, it will reference these records in `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` to de-duplicate the data. This will ensure that only the most recent version of a record exists in the `emails` table.

  - title: "Effects of Primary Key changes"
    anchor: "effects-of-primary-key-changes"
    content: |
      Replication issues can arise if Primary Keys in the source change, or if data in the `{{ primary-keys-table.name }}` is incorrectly altered or removed.

      Along with being unable to load data, Stitch will surface the following error if this occurs:

      ```
      Primary Keys for table do not match Primary Keys of incoming data
      ```

      If you recieve this error, you should [reset the table(s)]({{ link.replication.reset-rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) mentioned in the error. This will queue a full re-replication of the table, which will ensure Primary Keys are correctly captured and used to de-dupe data when loading.
