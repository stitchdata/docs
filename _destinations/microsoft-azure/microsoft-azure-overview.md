  {% capture setup-notice %}
  Stitch's {{ destination.display_name }} destination only works with Microsoft's [Azure SQL Data Warehouse product](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/sql-data-warehouse/){:target="new"}.

  Stitch doesn't currently support using Azure SQL Server or Azure SQL Database as a destination.

          After the data is extracted from your integrations, Stitch will perform the following steps to prepare and load that data into your {{ destination.display_name }} destination.

            anchor: "load-into-blob-storage"
            content: |
              The first step in the loading process for {{ destination.display_name }} destinations is to load the extracted data into [Azure Blob Storage](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/storage/blobs/storage-blobs-introduction){:target="new"}.

              Blob storage is intended for storing massive amounts of unstructured data. In the next step, Stitch will use Polybase to retrieve the data from Blob Storage and prepare it for loading into {{ destination.display_name }}.

          - title: "Step 2: Prep data using Polybase"
            anchor: "prep-data-polybase"

              {% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Note**: Polybase has its own set of limitations that may make it impossible to load certain data. Refer to the [Limitations](#limitations) section for more info." %}

              [Polybase](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/relational-databases/polybase/polybase-guide?view=sql-server-2017){:target="new"} is a Microsoft offering that integrates Microsoft SQL products with Hadoop. Polybase is needed to query data from Azure Blob Storage.

              In this step, Stitch will perform the following:

              1. **Create an external data source**. This creates an [external data source](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-external-data-source-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017){:target="new"} for the Polybase queries Stitch will run.
              2. **Create an external file format**. This creates [an object that defines the external (extracted) data](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-external-file-format-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017){:target="new"} Stitch will load. This is used in the next step to create an external table.
              3. **Create an external table**. Using the external file format, this will [create an external table](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/statements/create-external-table-transact-sql?view=sql-server-2017){:target="new"}. The external table is used to stage the data from Azure blob storage and load it into your {{ destination.display_name }} data warehouse.

            anchor: "bulk-load-from-polybase"
            content: |
              Lastly, Stitch will insert the data from the external table in Polybase into your {{ destination.display_name }} data warehouse.
