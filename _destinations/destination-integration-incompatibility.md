      When selecting a destination, it's important to first verify that all the data sources you want to connect to Stitch will be compatible. 

      **As Stitch currently allows only one destination per account,** we recommend verifying your integrations' compatibility before connecting a destination. This will ensure that you can successfully connect and replicate data from all your sources.

      The compatibility of any integration/destination combination falls into one of three categories: **always** compatible, **sometimes** compatible, and **never** compatible.

      The matrices below use the following icons to indicate the degree of incompatibility for an integration/destination combo:

      - {{ supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","" }} indicates that, as far as we know, this combo is **always** compatible.
      - {{ sometimes-supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","" }} indicates that this combo is **sometimes** compatible - there may be compatibility issues, but they're infrequent or parts of the integration may still be usable.
      - {{ not-supported | replace:"TOOLTIP","" }} indicates that this combo is **never** compatible. It's unlikely that Stitch will be able to load data from this integration into the given destination.

      Below you'll find a list of integrations that may have full or partial incompatibility with any of Stitch's destination offerings.
