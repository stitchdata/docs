      When Stitch replicates your data, we'll load it into the destination of your choosing.

      **As Stitch currently only allows you to connect one destination to your account**, we recommend asking yourself the questions below before making your selection. By fully assessing each choice first, you'll decrease the likelihood of needing to switch destinations or re-replicate all of your data at a later date.

       - [Does it support all (or most of) your data sources](#integration--destination-compatibility)?
       - [Will the structure of the data replicated by Stitch work with how you plan to use it](#data-structure)?
       - [Do you need a fully-managed solution, or can you perform maintenance tasks on your own](#setup--maintenance)?
       - [Is the destination's pricing structure suitable](#pricing)?

      In the tabs below is a quick look at each of Stitch's destinations and how they compare to each other.

      The remaining sections of this guide expand on the information in these tabs.

      If you simply want to try Stitch and Redshift, or if you don't have the ability to spin up a Redshift cluster of your own in AWS, we recommend trying [Panoply]({{ link.destinations.overviews.panoply | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#setup" }}). With just a few clicks, you create your own fully-managed Redshift data warehouse and start replicating data in minutes.

      **Note**: If you decide to [switch destinations]({{ link.destinations.overviews.switch-destination | prepend: site.baseurl }}) later, you'll need to queue a full re-replication of your data to ensure historical data is present in the new destination.

  - title: "Destination and data source compatibility"
    anchor: "integration--destination-compatibility"
    summary: "Are your data sources compatible with your destination?"
    content: |
      Some integrations may be partially or fully incompatible with some of the destinations offered by Stitch. For example: Some destinations don't support storing multiple data types in the same column. If a SaaS integration sends over a column with mixed data types, some destinations may "reject" the data.

      For integrations that allow you to control how data is structured, you may be able to fix the problem at the source and successfully replicate the data. If this is not possible, however, Stitch may never be able to successfully replicate the incompatible data.

      Refer to the [Integration and destination compatibility reference]({{ link.destinations.overviews.compatibility | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.

  - title: "Replication, transformations, and data structure"
    anchor: "replication-transformations"
    summary: "Will the structure of the data suit your needs?"
    content: |
      While the majority of your data will look the same across our destinations, there are some key differences you should be aware of:

      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.summary }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}
    subsections:
      - title: "Loading behavior and updates to existing records"
        anchor: "incremental-and-append-only-replication"
        summary: "How updates to existing records are handled"
        content: |
          Loading behavior determines how data is loaded into your destination. Specifically, how updates are made to existing rows in the destination.

          Stitch supports two loading behavior types:

          - **Upsert**: {{ site.data.tooltips.upsert }}
          - **Append-Only**: {{ site.data.tooltips.append-only }}

          The table below lists the default loading behavior for each destination and whether it can be configured.

          {% include misc/icons.html %}

          **Note**: If a destination supports and is configured to use Upsert loading, Stitch will attempt to use Upsert loading before Append-Only. All [other conditions for Upsert loading]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}#upsert-loading-conditions) must also be met.

          Refer to the [Understanding loading behavior guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples of each loading bheavior type.

          {% assign attributes = "Destination|Version|Default loading behavior|Loading behavior is configurable?" | split:"|" %}

          {% assign destinations = site.destinations | where:"destination",true | sort:"display_name" %}

      - title: "Nested data structures"
        anchor: "nested-data-structures"
        summary: "How destinations handle nested data structures"
        content: |
          Some destinations don't natively support nested structures, meaning that before Stitch can load replicated data, these structures must be "de-nested". During this process, Stitch will flatten nested structures into relational tables and subtables. As a result of creating subtables, a higher number of rows will be used.

          If a destination does natively support nested structures, no de-nesting will occur and Stitch will store the records intact.

          Check out the [Handling of Nested Data & Row Count Impact guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for an in-depth look at what we mean by nested records, how Stitch handles nested data, and what those records will look like in your data warehouse.

    summary: "What type of maintenance do you need?"
    content: |
      With the exception of a self-hosted PostgreSQL instance, all the destinations offered by Stitch are cloud-hosted databases, meaning you won't have to factor in server maintenance when making a decision.

      In the table below are:

      - **Fully-managed destinations** that include routine maintenance and upgrades in their plans
      - **DIY destinations** that will require you to perform and schedule maintenance tasks on your own

  - title: "Destination pricing models"

    summary: "What's the destination's pricing structure?"
    content: |
      Every destination offered by Stitch has its own pricing structure. Some providers charge by overall usage, others by an hourly rate or the amount of stored data. Depending on your needs, some pricing structures may fit better into your budget.

      In the next section, you'll find each destination's pricing structure, including a link to detailed price info and whether a free option (trial or plan) is available. Here are a few things to keep in mind:

      {% assign attributes = "Destination|Version|Pricing model|Notes" | split:"|" %}

      <table class="attribute-list">
      <tr>
      {% for attribute in attributes %}
