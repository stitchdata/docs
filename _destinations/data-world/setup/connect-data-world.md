Stitch is not involved with the management of {{ destination.display_name }} data warehouses. If you have billing questions or need help regarding your {{ destination.display_name }} data warehouse, [reach out to {{ destination.display_name }}]({{ destination.documentation }}).

{{ destination.description | flatify }} With just a few clicks, you can connect your {{ destination.display_name }} account to Stitch and get the data flowing.

1. Click the {{ app.menu-paths.destination-settings }}.
2. Click the **{{ destination.display_name }}** icon.
3. Click the **Sign in with {{ destination.display_name }}** button.
4. At the prompt, sign into your {{ destination.display_name }} account.
5. Next, you'll be asked to authorize Stitch to access your {{ destination.display_name }} account. Stitch will request permission to perform the following:
   - **Access your profile information**: This is required to identify and connect to your account.
   - **Read datasets and projects**: This is required to load replicated data into your destination.
   - **Write to datasets and projects**: This is required to load replicated data into your destination.
6. Click **Authorize Stitch**.
7. After the authorization process is successfully completed, you'll be directed back to Stitch to verify your {{ destination.display_name }} account ID.

   Stitch will use your {{ destination.display_name }} Account ID by default, but you can use a different ID if desired. For example: For a user named `stitch-data-world`, Stitch would default to using `stitch-data-world` as the Account ID.

   To use a different ID, click the link and enter the ID in the **Use This Account ID** field:

8. When finished, click **Save Settings** to save and test the connection.
