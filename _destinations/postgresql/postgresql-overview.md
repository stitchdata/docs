        anchor: "pricing"
        content: |
          Pricing for {{ destination.display_name }} depends on where your instance is hosted.

          - **Self-hosted:** {{ destination.display_name }} is open-source, meaning you don't need to pay an upfront cost to obtain the necessary software. You may, however, have hosting and maintenance costs associated with the server housing the instance. You may have to do a little bit of internal number crunching to figure out these potential costs. 

          - **Heroku:** Heroku has a [variety of plans to choose from](https://www.heroku.com/pricing), and [a guide to help you select the right plan](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/heroku-postgres-plans){:target="new"} for you or your company.

          - **Amazon Aurora and RDS:** Amazon offers [a variety of plans](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/postgresql/pricing/) for both on-demand instances and Multi-AZ Deployment. To get an estimate of what your monthly bill might look like, check out their [monthly calculator]({{ site.data.destinations.postgres.resource-links.aws-calculator }}){:target="new"}.

          - **Google CloudSQL PostgreSQL:** Unlike many other cloud-based data warehouse solutions, [Google's pricing model]({{ site.data.destinations.postgres.resource-links.cloudsql-pricing }}){:target="new"} is based on **usage** and not a fixed-rate. This means that your bill can vary over time. 

             Before fully committing yourself to using Google CloudSQL PostgreSQL as your data warehouse, we recommend familiarizing yourself with Google's pricing model and [using their pricing calculator to estimate your potential costs]({{ site.data.destinations.postgres.resource-links.price-calculator }}){:target="new"}.

    subsections:
      - title: "Replication process overview"
        anchor: "replication-process-overview"
        content: |
          A Stitch replication job consists of three stages:

          {% for sub-subsection in subsection.sub-subsections %}
          - [{{ sub-subsection.title }}](#{{ sub-subsection.anchor }})
          {% endfor %}
        sub-subsections:
          - title: "Step 1: Data extraction"
            anchor: "replication--data-extraction"
            content: |
              {% include replication/replication-process-phases.html phase="data-extraction" %}

          - title: "Step 2: Preparation"
            anchor: "replication--stitch-internal-pipeline"
            content: |
              {{ site.data.tooltips.prepare }} Refer to the [System overview guide]({{ link.getting-started.basic-concepts | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#system-architecture--preparing" }}) for a more detailed explanation of the Preparation phase.

          - title: "Step 3: Loading"
            anchor: "replication--loading"
            content: |
              Stitch loads the data into {{ destination.display_name }}.

      - title: "Loading behavior"
        anchor: "loading-behavior"
        content: |
          {% assign version = destination.this-version | prepend: "v" %} 
          By default, Stitch will use **{{ site.data.destinations[destination.type][version]replication.default-loading-behavior }} loading** when loading data into {{ destination.display_name }}.

          If the conditions for Upsert loading aren't met, data will be loaded using Append-Only loading.

          Refer to the [Understanding loading behavior guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.

      - title: "Primary Keys"
        anchor: "replication--primary-keys"
        content: |
          Stitch requires Primary Keys to de-dupe incrementally replicated data. When tables are created in the destination, Stitch will apply [Primary Key constraints](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/static/ddl-constraints.html#DDL-CONSTRAINTS-PRIMARY-KEYS){:target="new"} to columns used as Primary Keys. Primary Key constraints require that column values be unique and not null.

      - title: "Incompatible sources"
        anchor: "replication--incompatible-sources"
        content: |
          {% include shared/incompatibilities/destination-version-incompatibilities.html %}

  - title: "Transformations"
    anchor: "transformations"
    content: |
      {% for subsection in section.subsections %}
      - [{{ subsection.title }}](#{{ subsection.anchor }})
      {% endfor %}
    subsections:
      - title: "System tables and columns"
        anchor: "transformations--system-tables-columns"
        content: |
          Stitch will create the following tables in each integration's dataset:

          - [{{ stitch.system-tables.sdc-rejected.name }}]({{ link.destinations.storage.rejected-records | prepend: site.baseurl }})

          Additionally, Stitch will insert [system columns]({{ link.destinations.storage.system-tables-and-columns | prepend: site.baseurl }}) (prepended with `{{ system-column.prefix }}`) into each table.

# Refer to the [Data typing documentation]({{ link.getting-started.basic-concepts | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#data-typing" }}) for more info.
      - title: "Data typing"
        anchor: "transformations--data-typing"
        content: |
          Stitch converts data types only where needed to ensure the data is accepted by {{ destination.display_name }}. In the table below are the data types Stitch supports for {{ destination.display_name }} destinations, and the Stitch types they map to.

          {% include replication/templates/data-types/destination-data-types.html display-intro=true %}

      - title: "JSON structures"
        anchor: "transformations--json-structures"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} destinations don't have native support for nested data structures. To ensure nested data can be loaded, Stitch will flatten objects and arrays into columns and subtables, respectively. For more info and examples, refer to the [Handling nested data structures guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}).

      - title: "Column names"
        anchor: "transformations--column-naming"
        content: |
          Column names in {{ destination.display_name }}:

          {{ site.data.destinations.postgres.destination-details.column-name-rules | flatify | markdownify }}

          Stitch will perform the following transformations to ensure column names adhere to the rules imposed by {{ destination.display_name }}:

          {% include destinations/templates/destination-column-name-transformations.html %}

      - title: "Timezones"
        anchor: "transformations--timezones"
        content: |
          {{ destination.display_name }} will store the value as `TIMESTAMP WITH TIMEZONE`. In {{ destination.display_name }}, this data is stored with timezone information and expressed as UTC.

  - title: "Compare destinations"
    anchor: "compare-destinations"
    content: |
      **Not sure if {{ destination.display_name }} is the data warehouse for you?** Check out the [Choosing a Stitch Destination]({{ link.destinations.overviews.choose-destination | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide to compare each of Stitch's destination offerings.
