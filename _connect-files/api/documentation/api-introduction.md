      The Stitch Connect API enables you to seamlessly integrate Stitchâ€™s data pipeline functionality into your own platform. This API is a RESTful, resource-oriented API that allows you to programmatically provision Stitch accounts, create and modify data sources, and configure destination connections.

      Each endpoint uses standard HTTP verbs like GET and POST, and will return [standard HTTP response codes]({{ api.response-codes }}) to indicate request status or errors.

      We built the API to accept and return [JSON](http://json.org) in all responses, including [errors]({{ api.error-message-formats }}).

      Using the API, you can:

      - Create and access Stitch client accounts
      - Create and update destinations
      - Create and update data sources

      {% capture source-config %}
      To fully configure a data source, you will also need to use the [{{ js.name }}]({{ js.section | prepend: site.baseurl | flatify }}). This will send the user to Stitch, where they will be prompted to authorize access to the data source and select streams (tables) for replication.
      {% endcapture %}
