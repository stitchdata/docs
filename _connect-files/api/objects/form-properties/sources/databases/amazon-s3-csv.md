    required: true
    description: |
      The external ID associated with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) Identity Access Management (IAM) role used by Stitch. In AWS, external IDs are used to increase role security when granting access to accounts that you don't own or have administrative access to. Stitch will provide this ID when accessing {{ form-property.display-name }}.

      This value can be anything, but it must be the same as the external ID provided in the AWS console when creating the Stitch IAM role. Refer to the [{{ form-property.display-name }} documentation]({{ doc-link | append: "#create-stitch-iam-role" }}) for more info.
    value: "stitch_connection_12345"

      The name of the AWS IAM role Stitch should assume when extracting data from Amazon S3. This role will have the permissions in the IAM policy associated with the role.

      Refer to our [{{ form-property.display-name }} documentation]({{ doc-link | append: "#grant-access-bucket-iam" }}){:target="new"} for more info about the IAM policy, role, and how to create them in AWS.

  - name: "tables"
    type: "string"
    required: true
    description: |
      A series of properties defining the CSV files to be tracked as tables. For every table configuration, this property will contain a JSON object with the following properties. Every property should be a string.

      - **search_pattern** - The search criteria Stitch should use when selecting CSV files for extraction. This can be the name of a single file or a regular expression. For example: `customers.csv` or `*\.csv`
      - **search_prefix** - The directory path Stitch should limit the file search to. For example: `exports/data`
      - **table_name** - The name of the table as it should appear in the destination. For example: `customers`
      - **key_properties** - A comma-separated list of header fields in the CSV Stitch can use to uniquely identify records. For example: `_id,date`

         **Note**: If undefined, data will be loaded to the table in an append-only fashion. Refer to the [{{ form-property.display-name }} documentation]({{ doc-link | append: "#primary-keys-append-only" }}) for more info.
      - **date_overrides** - A comma-separated list of header fields in the CSV that should be typed as `datetime` fields in the destination. For example: `updated_at,created_at`

         **Note:** If columns aren't specified and values can't be parsed as dates, Stitch will load data for the columns as nullable strings. Refer to the [{{ form-property.display-name }} documentation]({{ doc-link | append: "#determining-data-types" }}) for more info.
      - **delimiter** - The field separator delimiter used in the CSV files. Accepted values are:

         - `,` - Comma
         - `|` - Pipe
         - `\t` - Tab
