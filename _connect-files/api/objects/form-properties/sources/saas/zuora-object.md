      The username of the Zuora user authorizing the connection. To successfully create a connection, this user must:

      1. **Have Standard user permissions across the board**,
      2. **Have two-factor authentication disabled**. Refer to this [Zuora article](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CF_Users_and_Administrators/Two-Factor_Authentication) for assistance in disabling this setting.
      3. **Have credentials that don't expire**. This is only applicable if Password Expiration rules are enforced. Refer to [Zuora's documentation](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/kb/How_do_I_prevent_my_API_user_login_from_expiring%3F) for a workaround.

      For more info, refer to our [Zuora integration documentation]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/zuora#create-the-zuora-user).
