  - content: |
      The Import API uses an [API access token]({{ link.import-api.guides.access-tokens | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to authenticate requests. Import API access tokens can be generated and managed in the **{{ app.page-names.int-settings }}** page for any Import API integration in your [Stitch account]({{ site.sign-in }}){:target="new"}.

      Authentication is performed via bearer auth, where your Import API access token is provided in the header of your request as `-H 'Authorization: Bearer at_<IMPORT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN>'`. 

      Your API access token has write access to the Stitch integration schema or dataset in your destination. Because of this, API access tokens should be treated like passwords - don't share them in publicly accessible places like Stackoverflow, GitHub, etc. **Note**: You also shouldn't share your API access token with Stitch Support. If sharing requests, remember to redact the API access token before sending.

      If an API access token is ever lost or compromised, you can revoke it and create a new token.

      Refer to the [Stitch Import API access token]({{ link.import-api.guides.access-tokens | prepend: site.baseurl }}) documentation for more info.

      For some the [Push]({{ site.data.import-api.core-objects.push.anchor }}) and [Validate push request]({{ site.data.import-api.core-objects.validate.anchor }}) endpoints, you'll need to include your Stitch client ID for every record contained in a request body. Your Stitch client ID is the unique ID associated with your Stitch account.

      ```json
      curl -X POST {{ site.data.import-api.api.base-url | append: site.data.import-api.core-objects.push.url }} \
        -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
        -H 'Authorization: Bearer <IMPORT_API_ACCESS_TOKEN>' \
        -d $
        '[
          {
            "client_id": 7723,              /* Stitch client ID */
            "table_name": "customers",
            "sequence": 1565880017,
            "data": {
              "id": 4,
              "name": "Beamo"
            },
            "key_names": [
              "id"
            ],
            "action": "upsert"
          },
          {
            "client_id": 7723,              /* Stitch client ID */
            "table_name": "orders",
            "sequence": 1565838645,
            "key_names": [
              "order_id"
            ],
            "data": {
              "order_id": 561,
              "customer_id": 4
            },
            "action": "upsert"
          }
        ]'
        ```

      {{ site.data.import-api.general.attributes.client-id | remove: "The Stitch client ID associated with your Stitch account." }}

      A client ID may have multiple API access tokens associated with it, but an API access token will only ever be associated with a single client ID.
