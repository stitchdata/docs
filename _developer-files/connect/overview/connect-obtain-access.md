      To use the Connect API, you'll need an API access token. This is necessary for authenticating to the API. Refer to the [Authentication reference]({{ link.connect.api | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#authentication" }}) for more info.

      To learn more about using the Connect JavaScript Client, check out the [JavaScript Reference]({{ js.section | prepend: site.baseurl | flatify }}). **Note**: This feature has been deprecated and shouldn't be built against for production use.
