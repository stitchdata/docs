      Stitch connects to a large, diverse universe of applications and data warehouses, each of which is configured differently. Connection property objects contain the properties necessary to create a source or destination object.

      Refer to the [Connection Property Object Reference]({{ link.connect.guides.connection-reference | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for details about these objects and the info required to configure them.
