      Defines the number, in days, [Stitch should use as an attribution window]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/facebook-ads#attribution-windows-data-extraction). An attribution window is the period of time for attributing results to ads and the lookback period after those actions occur during which ad results are counted.

      Accepted values, in days:

      - `1`
      - `7`
      - `28`

      To ensure your {{ form-property.display-name }} and Stitch settings align, we recommend using the same attribution window in Stitch that you use in {{ form-property.display-name }}. For example: If the attribution window is 28 days in Facebook, this value should be `28`.

      If your click and view windows differ, you should select the **greater** of the two. For example: If clicks have a window of `7` days and views have a window of `1` day, you should enter `7` for this setting.
    value: "7"
