uses-common-fields: true

# NOTE: object-attributes is only required if the object has attributes
# 		  that are specific to it. Ex: platform.s3-csv has a `bucket` attribute
#				that is only specific to S3.
# 			Otherwise, when `uses-common-fields` is `true`, the applicable fields
#				from _data/connect/common/database-sources.yml will display. You don't
# 			need to do a thing :)
# 			Other common fields:  _data/connect/common/all-sources.yml

#				Please remove me ^
