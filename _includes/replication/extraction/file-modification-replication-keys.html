<!-- This file includes content that describes how key-based incremental
    replication works for integrations that are file system-based.
    An example is Amazon S3 CSV, or Heap (which is based on S3). -->

While data from {{ integration.display_name }} integrations is replicated using [Key-based Incremental Replication]({{ link.replication.key-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the behavior for this integration differs subtly from other integrations.

The table below compares Key-based Incremental Replication and [Replication Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}) behavior for {{ integration.display_name }} to that of other integrations.

<table class="attribute-list">
