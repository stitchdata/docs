## Extracting data from {{ integration.display_name }} {#extract-data}

When you connect a database as an input, Stitch only needs read-only access to the databases, {{ object }}s, and {{ col }}s you want to replicate. There are two processes Stitch runs during the Extraction phase of the replication process: a structure sync and a data sync.

### Structure syncs

This is the first part of the Extraction process. During this phase, Stitch will detect any changes to the structure of your database. For example: A new {{ col }} is added to one of the {{ object }}s you set to replicate in Stitch. Structure syncs are how Stitch identifies the databases, tables, and columns to display in the Stitch app.

{{ extraction[integration.db-type].structure-sync | flatify | markdownify }}

### Data syncs

This is the second part of the Extraction process. During this phase, Stitch extracts data from the source and replicates it. {% unless integration.db-type == "mongo" %}The method Stitch uses is the same for all databases, but differs depending on the Replication Method that each {{ object }} uses.{% endunless %}

The tabs below contain info about the queries Stitch runs during the data syncs for each type of Replication Method supported for {{ integration.display_name }} integrations.

{% if integration.db-type == "mongo" %}
**Note**: {{ integration.display_name }} integrations only support Key-based Incremental replication.

### Recommendations

While we make every effort to ensure the queries that Stitch executes don’t impart significant load on your databases, we still have some recommendations for guaranteeing database performance:

- **Use a replica database instead of connecting directly**. We recommend using read replicas in lieu of directly connecting production databases with high availability and performance requirements.
- **Apply indexes to [Replication Key]({{ rep-keys-doc-link }}) {{ col }}s**. We restrict and order our replication queries by this {{ col }}, so applying an index to the {{ col }}s you’re using as Replication Keys can improve performance. {% if integration.db-type == "mongo" %}**Indexes are required to use Mongo fields as Replication Keys**.{% endif %}
