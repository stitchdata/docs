## Replication Key requirements {#replication-key-requirements}

{% if page.title contains "Mongo" %}
Stitch uses a field you define - called a Replication Key - to identify new and updated data for replication. For MongoDB integrations, Stitch requires that the Replication Key field:

1. be single field indexed, AND
2. exist in the **root** of the document.

If you want to replicate MongoDB data and are going to add query parameters - which is what [Key-based Incremental Replication]({{ link.replication.key-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl}}) does - undue stress could be put on your MongoDB database. By indexing the fields you want to replicate, that stress can be relieved.

{% else %}

To use [Key-based Incremental Replication]({{site.baseurl}}/replication/replication-methods#incremental-replication), a table must contain one of the following column types to be used as the Replication Key:

- a large integer, which includes `BIGINT`, `INT` and `MEDIUMINT`
- `datetime`
- `timestamp`

When Stitch replicates your data, it will store the last recorded maximum value in the Replication Key column and compare it against the data source - **not what's in your destination** - to identify new/updated data. 

Any row with a Replication Key value greater than or equal to the stored value is where Stitch will begin the next replication job.
