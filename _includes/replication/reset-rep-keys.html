**Replication Keys can be reset for database and (most) SaaS integrations.**
{% endif %}

There may be times when you need to fully replicate a {{ object }} (or {{ object }}s) that usually update incrementally. If, for example, you add a new {{ col }} and want to backfill data for already-replicated rows, forcing a full re-sync of the {{ object }} will populate the {{ col }} for existing rows and replicate new records. You can do this by resetting Replication Keys.
{% else %}
If you need to backfill already-replicated rows with data from the newly syncing column, you can **reset the table's Replication Key.** This will force a full re-sync of the table, populate the column in existing rows, and replicate new records.
{% endif %}

{% capture reset-rep-key %}
Note that this process:

1. Will **delete and re-create** your destination tables with a **full re-replication of your source data**.
2. Will lead to increased row counts which will count towards your limit.
3. Cannot be interrupted or reversed once confirmed.

If you have questions or concerns about resetting Replication Keys, we encourage you to reach out to support before proceeding.

{% unless page.title contains "Mongo" %}### Resetting Database Integration Replication Keys{% endunless%}

{% if page.title contains "Mongo" %}Mongo Replication Keys can be reset at the **integration** level only.
{% else %}
Replication Keys in database integrations can be reset at the **integration** or the **{{ object }}** level.

- At the **integration** level, the reset will clear the replication key value for ALL {{ object }}s AND queue a full re-sync **for all {{ object }}s in the integration.**
- At the **{{ object }}** level, the reset will clear the replication key value AND queue a full re-sync **for that {{ object }} only**.
{% endif %}

To reset Replication Keys, do the following:

1. Click into the integration from the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} page.
{% if page.title contains "Mongo"%}
2. Click {{ app.buttons.update-int-settings }}.
{% else %}
2. Next:
   - **To reset the entire integration**: Click the {{ app.buttons.update-int-settings }} link and **skip to step 3**.
   - **To reset a {{ object }}**: Locate the {{ object }} you want and click into it. Click the **{{ Object }} Settings** link, located near the top right corner, and **proceed to step 3.**
{% endif %}
3. Scroll down to the **Reset Replication Keys** section.
4. Click the **Reset Keys** button.
5. When prompted, click **OK** to confirm.
6. A **Success!** message will display at the top of the page.

At this point, a full re-sync of the integration will be queued. Note that if there is a large volume of data to be replicated, it may take some time before you see the changes in your data warehouse.

### Resetting SaaS Integration Replication Keys

Resetting the Replication Keys for a SaaS integration is done by changing the **Historical Sync** date in the {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page. **When this date is changed, all saved values will be overwritten AND a full re-sync of the integration will be queued.**

**This feature may not be available for some integrations.** Because this approach uses date-based replication, some integrations may be incompatible. For example: Pardot doesn't support date-based replication, meaning this feature will not be available for Pardot connections.

Changing the Historical Sync date has its own set of considerations and gotchas. Please refer to the [Syncing Historical SaaS Data]({{ link.replication.saas-historical | prepend: site.baseurl }}) guide for more info.
