1. **The number of tables set to replicate**. [The more tables that you select]({{ link.replication.syncing | prepend: site.baseurl }}), the potential higher number of rows.

2. **The Replication Methods used by the replicating tables**. Tables using [Full Table Replication]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) can increase your row usage.

3. **Integrations' replication schedules**. Integrations [scheduled to replicate on a frequent basis]({{ link.replication.rep-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}) can lead to increased row usage.

4. **The volume and structure of the data in the selected tables.** Some Stitch destinations - like Redshift and PostgreSQL - will break apart nested records and count each sub-record as a row. Refer to the [Nested data structures guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.nested-structures | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.
