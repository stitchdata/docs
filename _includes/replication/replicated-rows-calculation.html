1. The number of [**tables set to replicate**]({{ link.replication.syncing | prepend: site.baseurl }}),
2. The [**Replication Methods**]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}) used by the replicating tables,
3. The [**Replication Frequency**]({{ link.replication.rep-frequency | prepend: site.baseurl }}) of your integrations, which defines how **often** Stitch should attempt to replicate data from the selected tables, and
4. The **volume and** <a href="#" data-toggle="tooltip" data-original-title="If your data warehouse doesn't natively support nested structures, Stitch will de-nest these records, resulting in more rows replicated than what's in the source.">**structure**</a> of the data in the selected tables. Some Stitch destinations - like Redshift and Postgres - will break apart nested records and count each sub-record as a row.
