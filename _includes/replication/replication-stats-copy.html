Want to know where your data is in the replication process? The Replication Stats on the Integration Details page for every integration - **which will display only after the initial sync has completed** - can help you determine where your data is and check up on recently loaded data.

![Integration Replication Stats]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/replication/replication-stats.png)

**These stats are not real-time and will update every few minutes.** Remember to refresh the page if you're eager to watch your data move through Stitch.

## Stitch's Replication Process
Each part of the Stitch replication process has its own section and stats. The Stitch replication process consists of three steps:

- Extract
- Prepare
- Load

Every integration you connect to Stitch will have these stats on its {{ app.page-names.int-details }} page, which you can access by clicking into the integration from the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }}.

{% include replication/replication-stats.html %}

If your data hasn't shown up after a reasonable amount of time, [reach out to support](mailto: {{ site.support }}).

**To learn more about how info is displayed in these fields**, check out the [Monitoring Replication Progress guide]({{ link.replication.rep-progress | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
