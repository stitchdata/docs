1. Create a rule for the virtual machine's IP address:
   - **Rule name**: Enter a name for the rule. For example: `Stitch VM`
   - **Start IP**: Paste the virtual machine's private IP address.
   - **End IP**: Paste the virtual machine's private IP address again.

   Below is what the rule should look like when finished:
   
   ![IP rule for a virtual machine]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/azure-sql-dw-vm-ip-rule.png)
1. Click **Save**.

<!-- For direct connections only -->
{% else %}
1. For each of Stitch's IP addresses listed below, create a rule:
   - **Rule name**: Enter a name for the rule. For example: `Stitch<number>`
   - **Start IP**: Paste one of Stitch's IP addresses.
   - **End IP**: Paste the same IP address.

   Stitch's IP addresses are:

   {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
    - {{ ip-address.ip | remove: "/32" }}
    {% endfor %}
1. Click the three dots to the right of the **End IP** field to add the rule.
1. Repeat steps {{ steps }} until there is a rule for each IP address. The screen should look similar to the following when you're finished:
