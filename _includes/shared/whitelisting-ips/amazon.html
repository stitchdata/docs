For Stitch to successfully connect with your database instance, you'll need to add our IP addresses to the appropriate Security Group via the AWS management console.

Security Groups must reside in the same VPC as the instance. Use the instructions below to create a security group for Stitch and grant access to the VPC.

1. Log into your AWS account.
2. Navigate to the Security Group Management page, typically **Services > Compute > EC2**.
3. Click the **Security Groups** option, under **Network & Security** in the menu on the left side of the page.
4. Click **Create Security Group**.
5. In the window that displays, fill in the fields as follows:
   - **Security group name**: Enter a unique name for the Security Group. For example: `Stitch`
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the security group.
   - **VPC**: Select the VPC that contains the database you want to connect to Stitch. **Note**: The Security Group and database must be in the same VPC, or the connection will fail.
6. In the **Inbound** tab, click **Add Rule**.
7. Fill in the fields as follows:
   - **Type**: Select `Custom TCP Rule`
   - **Port Range**: Enter the port your database uses. (`{{ port }}` by default)
   - **CIDR, IP or Security Group**: Enter one of the IP addresses listed below:

        {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
        - {{ ip-address.ip }}
        {% endfor %}
8. Click **Add Rule** to add an additional Inbound rule.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until all the IP addresses above have been added:
