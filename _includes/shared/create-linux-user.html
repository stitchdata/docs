1. Run the following commands as root on your Linux server to create a user named `stitch`:

   ```shell
   adduser --disabled-password stitch
   mkdir /home/stitch/.ssh
   ```

2. Next, import the Public Key into `authorized_keys`, replacing `[PASTE KEY HERE]` with the [Stitch Public Key](#retrieve-your-public-key):

   ```shell
   "[PASTE KEY HERE]" >> /home/stitch/.ssh/authorized_keys
   ```

3. Alter the permissions on the `/home/stitch` directory to allow access via SSH:

   ```shell
   chown -R [stitch_username]:stitch /home/stitch
   chmod -R 700 /home/stitch/.ssh
   ```
