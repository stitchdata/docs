For Stitch to successfully connect with your RDS instance, you'll need to add our IP addresses to the appropriate database security group via the AWS management console. To do this, an inbound security rule must be created for each of our IP addresses.

The IP addresses can be added to an existing group or you can create a new one. The important thing is that the group is authorized to access the instance you want to connect to Stitch.

1. Log into your AWS account.
2. Navigate to the Security Group Management page, typically **Services > Compute > EC2**.
3. Click the **Security Groups** option, under **Network & Security** in the menu on the left side of the page.
4. Click **Create Security Group**.
5. In the window that displays, fill in the fields as follows:
   - **Security group name**: Enter a unique name for the security group. For example: `Stitch`
   - **Description**: Enter a description for the security group.
   - **VPC**: Verify that the selected VPC is the same VPC your database is in.
6. In the **Inbound** tab, click **Add Rule**.
7. Fill in the fields as follows:
   - **Type**: Select `Custom TCP Rule`
   - **Port Range**: Enter the port your database uses. (`{{ integration.port }}` by default)
   - **CIDR, IP or Security Group**, enter one of the IP addresses listed below:

        {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
        - {{ ip-address.ip }}
        {% endfor %}
8. Add another rule by clicking the **Add Rule** button.
9. Repeat steps 6-8 until all the IP addresses above have been added:

10. When finished, click **Create**.

For Stitch to successfully connect with your CloudSQL instance, you'll need to add our IP addresses to the database's authorized IP addresses list.

1. Sign into your Google Cloud Platform account.
2. Navigate to the [Cloud SQL Instances page](https://console.cloud.google.com/sql/instances?_ga=2.87743768.-1255434742.1523541209){:target="new"}.
3. Click the instance name to open its details page.
4. Click the **Authorization** tab.
5. For each of the following IP addresses, complete the following:

   1. Click **Add network**.
   2. In the **Name** field, enter a name for the IP address. For example: `Stitch-1` for the first IP address, `Stitch-2` for the second, and so on.
   3. In the **Network** field, paste **one** of the following IP addresses:
      {% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
      - {{ ip-address.ip }}
      {% endfor %}
   4. Click **Done**.
   5. Repeat these steps until all of Stitch's IP addresses have been added.

6. When finished, click **Save** to update the instance.

For the connection to be successful, you'll need to configure your firewall to allow access from our IP addresses. Whitelist the following IPs before continuing onto the next step:

{% for ip-address in ip-addresses %}
- {{ ip-address.ip }}
{% endfor %}
