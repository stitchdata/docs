## Troubleshooting connection errors

If you receive an error message, we recommend:

- Verifying that the **Connect using SSL** box in the {{ app.page-names.dw-settings }} page is checked. Heroku requires SSL to be enabled for the connection to be successful.
- Checking Herokuâ€™s Status Page for possible service outages.

If the errors persist, reach out to support.
