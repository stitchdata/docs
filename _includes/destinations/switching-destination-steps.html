<!-- This file contains the steps for switching
	to a new destination. -->

{% case include.type %}


<!-- SELECT HISTORICAL DATA SETTING -->
{% when 'select-historical-data-setting' %}
{% assign page-settings = site.data.ui.change-destinations-page %}

1. From the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }}, click the {{ app.menu-paths.destination-settings }}.
2. At the bottom of the page, click the {{ app.buttons.change-destination }} button.
3. In the **Historical Data** section, select how you want data to be replicated to the new destination:
   {% for field in page-settings.default-historical-data %}
   - {{ field.field }}: {{ field.copy | flatify }}
   {% endfor %}
4. Click **Continue**.


<!-- DELETE CURRENT DESTINATION -->
{% when 'delete-current-destination' %}
After clicking **Continue**, you'll be prompted to confirm the removal of the current destination's settings.

To continue with the switch, click **OK** to delete the current destination settings.

**Note**: This will not delete data in the destination itself - it only clears this destination's settings from Stitch.


<!-- UNPAUSE INTEGRATIONS -->
{% when 'unpause-integrations' %}
After you've successfully connected the new destination, un-pause your integrations. Your data will begin replicating according to the [historical data option](#select-historical-data-setting) you previously selected.
