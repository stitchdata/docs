{% if include.version-migration == true %}
1. Navigate back to the page where your Stitch account is open.
2. Click the **{{ destination.display_name }} with Updates** icon:
{% else %}
1. {{ site.data.app.sign-in | flatify }}
2. Click the {{ app.menu-paths.destination-settings }}.
3. Click the **{{ destination.display_name }} with Updates** icon:
{% endif %}


   ![Highlighted {{ destination.display_name }} v2 icon in the Stitch app]({{ site.baseurl }}/images/destinations/google-bigquery-v2-tile.png){:style="max-width: 450px;"}
4. Scroll to the **Your service account** section.
5. In the **Your Key File** field, click the <img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/icons/upload-file.svg" alt="File upload icon" style="border: 0px;"> icon and locate the JSON project key file you created in [Step 1.3](#create-json-project-key).

Once uploaded, the **BigQuery Project Name** field will automatically populate with the name of the GCP project in the JSON project key file.


<!-- SELECTING A GOOGLE CLOUD STORAGE LOCATION -->
{% when 'select-gcs-location' %}
Next, you'll select the region used by your Google Cloud Storage (GCS) instance. This setting determines the region of the internal [Google Storage Bucket](https://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/key-terms#buckets){:target="new"} Stitch uses during the replication process.

Using the **Google Cloud Storage Location** dropdown, select your GCS region. Refer to the [{{ destination.display_name }} v2 reference]({{ link.destinations.overviews.bigquery-v2 | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#supported-gcs-regions" }}) for the list of regions this version of the {{ destination.display_name }} destination supports.

**Note**: Changing this setting will result in replication issues if data migration isn't completed correctly.


<!-- DEFINING LOADING BEHAVIOR -->
{% when 'define-loading-behavior' %}
{% capture loading-setting-note %}
**Note**: Loading behavior setting can't be changed after the destination is created. To change {{ destination.display_name }} loading behavior, you'll need to [delete and re-create the destination]({{ link.destinations.switch-destinations | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html type="single-line" content=loading-setting-note %}

The last step is to define how Stitch will handle changes to existing records in your {{ destination.display_name }} destination:

- **Upsert**: Existing rows will be updated with the most recent version of the record from the source. With this option, only the most recent version of a record will exist in {{ destination.display_name }}. 

- **Append**: Existing rows aren't updated. Newer versions of existing records are added as new rows to the end of tables. With this option, many versions of the record will exist in {{ destination.display_name }}, capturing how a record changed over time.

Refer to the [Understanding loading behavior guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.

**Note**: This setting may impact your {{ destination.display_name }} costs. [Learn more]({{ link.destinations.overviews.bigquery-pricing | prepend: site.baseurl }}).
