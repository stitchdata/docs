### Initial and historical replication jobs {#initial-sync}

After you finish setting up {{ integration.display_name }}, its **Sync Status** may show as **Pending** on either the {{ app.page-names.dashboard }} or in the {{ app.page-names.int-details }} page.

For a new integration, a **Pending** status indicates that Stitch is in the process of scheduling the initial replication job for the integration. **This may take some time to complete.**

{% capture anchor-scheduling-note %}
If using Anchor Scheduling, an initial replication job may not kick off immediately. This depends on the selected Replication Frequency and Anchor Time. Refer to the [Anchor Scheduling]({{ link.replication.rep-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#job-scheduling-and-anchor-times" }}) documentation for more information.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html first-line="**Initial replication jobs with Anchor Scheduling**" content=anchor-scheduling-note %}

#### Free historical data loads

The first seven days of replication, beginning when data is first replicated, are free. Rows replicated from the new integration during this time won't count towards your quota. Stitch offers this as a way of testing new integrations, measuring usage, and ensuring historical data volumes don't quickly consume your quota.

{% include note.html type="single-line" content="**Replication will continue after the seven days are over**. If you're no longer interested in this source, be sure to **pause** or **delete** the integration to prevent unwanted usage." %}
