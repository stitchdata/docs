    See this file for database integration instructions:
    _includes/integrations/shared-setup/data-selection/database-object-selection.html -->

1. In the {{ app.page-names.int-details }} page, click the {{ app.buttons.tables | replace:"Tables",button }} tab.
2. Locate a {{ object }} you want to replicate.
3. {{ app.menu-paths.sync | replace: "object",object }}
4. After you set a {{ object }} to replicate, a page with the {{ object }}'s {{ col }}s will display. De-select {{ col }}s if needed. **Note**: {{ integration.display_name }} tables replicate using Key-based Incremental Replication. Refer to the [Replication](#replication) section for more info.
1. Repeat this process for every {{ object }} you want to replicate.
