In the **Replication Frequency** section, you'll create the integration's [replication schedule]({{ link.replication.rep-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}). An integration's replication schedule determines how often Stitch runs a replication job, and the time that job begins.

Stitch offers two methods of creating a replication schedule:

- **Replication Frequency**: This method requires selecting the interval you want replication to run for the integration. Start times of replication jobs are based on the start time and duration of the previous job. Refer to the [Replication Frequency]({{ link.replication.rep-frequency | prepend: site.baseurl }}) documentation for more information and examples.
- **Anchor scheduling**: Based on the Replication Frequency, or interval, you select, this method "anchors" the start times of this integration's replication jobs to a time you select to create a predictable schedule. [Anchor scheduling]({{ link.replication.anchor-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl }}) is a combination of the Anchor Time and Replication Frequency settings, which must both be defined to use this method. Additionally, note that:

   - A **Replication Frequency of at least one hour** is required to use anchor scheduling.
   - **An initial replication job may not begin immediately after saving the integration**, depending on the selected Replication Frequency and Anchor Time. Refer to the [Anchor Scheduling]({{ link.replication.rep-scheduling | prepend: site.baseurl | append: "#job-scheduling-and-anchor-times" }}) documentation for more information.
   {% unless integration.anchor-scheduling == true %}
   - **You'll need to contact support to request using an Anchor Time with this integration.**

To help prevent overages, consider setting the integration to replicate less frequently. See the [Understanding and Reducing Your Row Usage guide]({{ link.billing.billing-guide | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for tips on reducing your usage.

<!-- Only display if integration enforces API limits -->
{% if integration.enforces-api-limits == true %}
{% capture api-limits %}
{{ integration.display_name }}'s API enforces usage limits. As a result, a high Replication Frequency may exceed these limits and impact Stitch's ability to replicate data. See the [Replication](#replication) section below for more details.
