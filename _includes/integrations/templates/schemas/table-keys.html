             Jekyll tends to add a lot of ugly white space to lists of Liquid variables, so 
             to get this to display nicely in the table snapshot, we have to:

             1. Run a forloop that captures the names of all attributes marked as PKs and save it as clean-keys,
             2. Append ":" to each attribute name (for visual separation),
             3. Split the clean-keys array, reverse it, join it, and then remove the first ":" (this is because Liquid doesn't have a remove_last filter) and save it as reverse-pk-keys
             4. Split the reverse-pk-keys array, reverse it, and join it again -->
