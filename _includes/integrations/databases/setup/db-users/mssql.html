Creating a user with `SELECT` privileges can either be done via a query or the {{ integration.display_name }} UI. In this section, we'll walk you through using the query method.
{% endunless %}

{% if integration.name == "microsoft-azure" %}
Depending on your setup and the access you grant to the Stitch database user, you may need to create several {{ integration.display_name }} integrations to allow Stitch to replicate all your data. This is due to a {{ integration.display_name }} limitation on how access is granted to `sys.database` views.

- If the Stitch user has access to the master database and this database is then used for authentication, you can replicate all databases that the user has access to from a single {{ integration.display_name }} integration setup.

- If the database you're replicating isn't the master database, you'll only be able to replicate schemas and tables within that database. This will require creating additional {{ integration.display_name }} integrations in Stitch.

1. Log into your database.
2. Create a SQL login for the Stitch database user:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.create-login-command | strip }}
   ```

3. Grant the Stitch user access to the database:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.grant-access-command | strip }}
   ```

4. Create the Stitch database user and map them to the database:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.create-user-command | strip }}
   ```

5. Grant the Stitch user `SELECT` privileges. To grant `SELECT` privileges to all tables in the database, run this command:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.grant-select-command.all-tables | strip }}
   ```

   If you want to limit the Stitch user to specific tables, run this command instead:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.grant-select-command.specific-tables | strip }}
   ```
