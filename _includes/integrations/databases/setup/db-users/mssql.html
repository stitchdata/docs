Creating a user with `SELECT` privileges can either be done via a query or the {{ integration.display_name }} UI. In this section, we'll walk you through using the query method.
{% endunless %}

{% if integration.name == "microsoft-azure" %}
Depending on your setup and the access you grant to the Stitch database user, you may need to create several {{ integration.display_name }} integrations to allow Stitch to replicate all your data. This is due to a {{ integration.display_name }} limitation on how access is granted to `sys.database` views.

- If the Stitch user has access to the master database and this database is then used for authentication, you can replicate all databases that the user has access to from a single {{ integration.display_name }} integration setup.

- If the database you're replicating isn't the master database, you'll only be able to replicate schemas and tables within that database. This will require creating additional {{ integration.display_name }} integrations in Stitch.

1. Create the Stitch database user, replacing `<database_name>` with the name of the database and `<password>` with a secure password:

   ```sql
   USE <database_name>
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.create-login-command | strip }}
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.create-user-command | strip }}
   ```

2. Grant the Stitch user `SELECT` privileges by running this command for every table you want to replicate: 

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.grant-select-on-table | strip }}
   ```

   Limiting access to only the tables you want to replicate ensures that the integration can complete discovery (a structure sync) in a timely manner. If you encounter issues in Stitch where tables aren't displaying, try limiting the Stitch database user's table access.

{% unless integration.log-based-replication-master-instance == false %}
   **Note:** Column-level permissions are not supported for use with Log-based Incremental Replication. Restricting access to columns will cause replication issues.

{% capture replication-privileges %}
Additionally, if you want to use Log-based Incremental Replication, you'll also need to grant the Stitch user `VIEW TRACKING CHANGES` privileges on the [tables where change tracking is enabled](#enable-table-change-tracking):

```sql
{{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mssql.grant-select-command.change-tracking-tables | strip }}
```

For every table you want to replicate, you'll need to run this command.
