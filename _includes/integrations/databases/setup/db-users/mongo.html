Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration is designed to use a user authentication method that requires Mongo database users to be validated against their authentication database. [Read more about Mongo authentication here](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/security-users/#authenticate-a-user).

Currently, Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration currently assumes the database entered in the Integration Settings page is the authentication database. Due to {{ integration.display_name }}'s authentication process and Stitch's current functionality, the database entered into Stitch in the next step must be the user's authentication database.

For Atlas-based instances, the Stitch user must be able to perform the actions listed below on the `admin` database and the other databases you want to query, if any. This is due to the design of Stitch's integration and Mongo's authentication requirements.

To successfully connect and replicate your {{ integration.display_name }} data, Stitch requires the ability to:

- Run the `listDatabases` command. This privilege is required so Stitch can detect the databases available for replication.
- Run the `listIndexes` command. Because Stitch will only display indexed fields as Replication Key options, this privilege is required to identify fields that can be used as Replication Keys.
- `COUNT` and query on all the databases you want to replicate data from. These privileges are required to replicate your data.
- Run the `dbVersion` command. While this isn’t mandatory, it’s beneficial for Stitch to have access to the information this command yields to troubleshoot any connection or replication issues that may arise.

You can assign a role to the Stitch user if you like, as long as the role has the necessary privileges to perform the actions listed above.

1. Connect to your {{ integration.display_name }} server.
2. Navigate to the authentication database. In this example, we're using `admin`:
   
   ```shell
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mongo.switch-database | strip }}
   ```

   **Note**: If you're connecting an Atlas-based instance, the authentication database will be `admin`.

3. Create the Stitch user, set a password, and optionally assign roles.

   If your {{ integration.display_name }} version is 3.x+, use `createUser`:

   ```java
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mongo.create-user-v3 | strip }}
   ```

   If your {{ integration.display_name }} version is below 3.x, use `addUser`:

   ```java
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mongo.create-user-v2 | strip }}
   ```
