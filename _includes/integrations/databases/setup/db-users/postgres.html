Your organization may require a different process, but the simplest way to create this user is to execute the following query when logged into the {{ integration.display_name }} database as a user with the right to grant privileges.

Additionally, this user should also own the schema that Stitch is being granted access to.

```sql
{{ postgres-setup.create-user-command-default }}
```

Replace `[secure password here]` with a secure password{% if integration.ssh == true %}, which can be different than the SSH password.{% else %}.{% endif %} Additionally, make sure you replace `[database_name]` and `[schema_name]` with the appropriate names in your database. Repeat this process as necessary if you want to connect multiple databases or schemas.

<!-- Just for RDS integrations -->
{% if integration.name contains "rds" %}

{% capture rds-replication-role %}
Additionally, if you want to use Log-based Replication, you'll also need to grant the `rds_replication` role to the Stitch user.

**Note**: Granting this role requires that you have the `rds_superuser` role. Log into the database as a user with the `rds_superuser` role and run the following command:

```sql
{{ postgres-setup.rds-grant-replication | strip }}
```
{% endcapture %}

{% include important.html first-line="**Using Log-based Incremental Replication**" content=rds-replication-role %}
{% endif %}
