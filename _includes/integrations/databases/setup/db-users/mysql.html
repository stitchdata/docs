1. Log into your database as a user with `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges.
2. Run the following command to create the Stitch database user:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mysql.create-user-command | flatify | rstrip }}
   ```

   Replace `<password>` with a secure password. {% if integration.ssh == true %}If using SSH, this can be different than the SSH password.{% endif %}

3. Grant the Stitch user `SELECT` privileges by running this command for every table you want to replicate: 

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mysql.grant-select-on-table | flatify | rstrip }}
   ```

   Limiting access to only the tables you want to replicate ensures that the integration can complete discovery (a structure sync) in a timely manner. If you encounter issues in Stitch where tables aren't displaying, try limiting the Stitch database user's table access.

{% unless integration.log-based-replication-master-instance == false %}
   **Note:** Column-level permissions are not supported for use with Log-based Incremental Replication. Restricting access to columns will cause replication issues.

{% capture replication-privileges %}
Additionally, if you want to use Log-based Incremental Replication, you'll also need to grant the Stitch user replication privileges:

```sql
{{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mysql.grant-user-replication-command | flatify | rstrip }}
```
{% endcapture %}
