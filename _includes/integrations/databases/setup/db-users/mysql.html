1. Log into your database as a user with `CREATE USER` and `GRANT OPTION` privileges.
2. Run the following command to create the Stitch database user:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mysql.create-user-command | flatify | rstrip }}
   ```

   Replace `[password]` with a secure password. {% if integration.ssh == true %}If using SSH, this can be different than the SSH password.{% endif %}

3. Grant the Stitch user `SELECT` privileges on the database:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mysql.grant-user-select-command | flatify | rstrip }}
   ```
   
   To restrict the Stitch user from accessing data in specific objects, you can instead run `GRANT` commands that only allow access to the data you permit. **Note**: Column-level permissions are not supported for use with Log-based Incremental Replication. Restricting access to columns will cause replication issues.

4. **If using Log-based Incremental Replication**, you'll also need to grant the Stitch user replication privileges:

   ```sql
   {{ site.data.taps.extraction.database-setup.user-privileges.mysql.grant-user-replication-command | flatify | rstrip }}
   ```
