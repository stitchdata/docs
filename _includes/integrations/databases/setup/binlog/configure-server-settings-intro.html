Before configuring Log-based Incremental Replication, note the following:

- **Not all database versions are supported.** Only Oracle databases using [a version from {{ integration.log-based-replication-minimum-version }} through {{ integration.log-based-replication-maximum-version }}](#setup-requirements) support [LogMiner]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]logminer }}){:target="new"}, which is required to use Log-based Incremental Replication in Stitch.
- **Some data types may not be supported**. Refer to the [Data types section](#data-types) for more info.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html first-line="**Note: Log-based Incremental Replication requirements and limitations**" content=log-based-notice %}

Log-based Incremental Replication is the most efficient way to replicate {{ integration.display_name }} data. Stitch uses [Oracle's LogMiner package]({{ site.data.taps.links[integration.db-type]logminer }}){:target="new"} to query Oracle's archive logs and retrieve all inserts, updates, and deletes to your database.

{% case integration.db-type %}
{% when 'mysql' %}
{% capture important %}
**To use binlog replication, your {{ integration.display_name }} database must be running MySQL version 5.6.2 or greater**.

Additionally, setting up binlog replication requires rebooting your database to ensure parameter changes take effect. To minimize disruptions, we recommend performing the reboot during non-peak usage hours.

{% include important.html first-line="**Requirements for configuring binlog replication**" content=important %}

{% when 'postgres' %}
{% capture replica-identity %}
**Note**: It is recommended to set the `REPLICA IDENTITY` parameter to `FULL` in your source table to capture all changed and unchanged keys in the Write-Ahead Logging. 

You can configure this with the following query: `ALTER TABLE <your_table> REPLICA IDENTITY FULL`.

{% include note.html type="single-line" content=replica-identity %}

While Log-based Incremental Replication is the most accurate and efficient method of replication, using this replication method may, at times, require manual intervention or impact the source database's performance. Refer to the [Log-based Incremental Replication documentation]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info.

You can also use one of Stitch's other [Replication Methods]({{ link.replication.rep-methods | prepend: site.baseurl }}), which don't require any database configuration. Replication Methods can be changed at any time.
