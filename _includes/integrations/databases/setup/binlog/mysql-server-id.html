{% capture server-id-note %}
This step is required if using Log-based Replication and any of the following are true:

1. You're connecting a read replica to Stitch
2. You're connecting multiple databases to Stitch, all of which are on the same {{ integration.display_name }} server. These can be read replicas, or databases on the master instance.
3. You're adding a new {{ integration.display_name }} Stitch integration, and the database is on the same server as other previously-connected databases. 
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html first-line="**Required for Log-based Replication**" content=server-id-note %}


When Stitch connects to your database and uses Log-based Replication, a unique server ID will be required. This ID ensures that the integration - or integrations, if you're connecting multiple databases - will not encounter conflicts during the replication process.

To avoid conflicts, you'll check which server IDs are currently in use and then define a new, unqiue ID in Stitch.

1. Log into the MySQL server that acts as the replication master.
2. Run the following statement:

   ```sql
   mysql> SHOW SLAVE HOSTS;
   ```

2. The `SHOW SLAVE HOSTS` statement will return information about servers that are or have been connected as replication slaves:

   ```sql
   +------------+-------------+------+-----------+------------+
   | Server_id  | Host        | Port | Master_id | Slave_UUID |
   +------------+-------------+------+-----------+------------+
   | 192168010  | stitch_prod | 3306 | 192168011 | <UUID>     |
   | 1921680101 | stitch_dev  | 3306 | 192168011 | <UUID>     |
   +------------+-------------+------+-----------+------------+
   ```

When you complete the setup in Stitch, you'll define a unique server ID for your Stitch {{ integration.display_name }} integration to use.
