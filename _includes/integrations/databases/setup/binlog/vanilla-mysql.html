1. Log into your {{ integration.display_name }} server.
2. Verify that binlog is enabled by running the following statement. The value returned should be `1`:
   
   ```shell
   mysql> select @@log_bin;
   ```

   If this statement returns a `0`, this means that binlog is disabled. You'll enable it in the next step.
3. Locate the `my.cnf` file, usually located at `/etc/my.cnf`. Verify that `my.cnf` has the following lines in the `{{ section-name | strip }}` section:

    {{ config-file-lines }}

   A few things to note:
      - `log_bin` doesn't have to be `mysql-binlog` - this value can be anything. Additionally, if `log_bin` already has an entry (which you checked in step one), you don't need to change it.
      - Use either `expire_log_days` or `binlog_expire_logs_seconds`, not both. See the **Server settings list** tab for more information.
      - Setting `log_slave_updates` is only required if you are connecting a **read replica**. This isn't required for master instances.
4. When finished, restart your {{ integration.display_name }} server to ensure the changes take effect.
