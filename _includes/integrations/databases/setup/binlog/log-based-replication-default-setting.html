In the **Log-based Replication** section, you can set this as the integration's default Replication Method.

When enabled, tables that are set to replicate will use [Log-based Incremental Replication]({{ link.replication.log-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) by default. If you don't want a table to use Log-based Incremental Replication, you can change it in the {{ app.page-names.table-settings }} page for that table.

If this setting isn't enabled, you'll have to select a [Replication Method](#sync-data) for each table you set to replicate.
