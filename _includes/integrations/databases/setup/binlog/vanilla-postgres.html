1. Log into your {{ integration.display_name }} server as a superuser.
2. Locate the database configuration file (usually `postgresql.conf`) and define the parameters as follows:

    {{ config-file-lines }}

   A few things to note:

   - `max_standby_archive_delay` and `max_standby_streaming_delay` are only applicable if you're connecting a read replica to Stitch. If you aren't connecing a read replica, you don't have to define these parameters.
   - For `max_replication_slots` and `max_wal_senders`, we're defaulting to a value of `5`. This should be sufficient **unless you have a large number of read replicas**.

3. When finished, restart your {{ integration.display_name }} server to ensure the changes take effect.
