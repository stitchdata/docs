After you've successfully connected your {{ integration.display_name }} integration, Stitch will continuously replicate your webhook data into your destination.

### Webhooks and historical data {#webhooks-historical-data}

Because {{ integration.display_name }} data is sent to Stitch in real-time, this means that **only new records are replicated to your destination.** Most webhook-based integrations don't retain historical data due to this as-it-happens approach.

{% case integration.name %}
{% when 'segment' %}
Segment, however, has a [historical replay feature](https://help.segment.com/hc/en-us/articles/206227946-Will-Segment-sync-my-historical-data-){:target="new"} available on some of their plans. **Reach out to their support team if you have questions about replaying your historical data.**

{% when 'delighted' %}
{{ integration.display_name }}, however, has the ability to push historical webhook data upon request. Reach out to the {{ integration.display_name }} Customer Concierge team at [hello@delighted.com](mailto:hello@delighted.com) to request your historical webhook data.

{% endcase %}

In the event that our webhook service experiences downtime, you may notice some lag between an event occurring and the data appearing in your destination.

### Loading behavior

This version of Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration loads data in an Append-Only fashion. {{ site.data.tooltips.append-only }} Data stored this way can provide insights and historical details about how those rows have changed over time.

Refer to the [Understanding loading behavior guide]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.

### Query for the latest data {#query-latest-data}

If you simply want the latest version of the object - or objects, if you elected to track more than one during the setup - in the integration’s table (`data`), you’ll have to adjust your querying strategy to account for the append-only method of replication. This is a little different than querying records that are updated using `updated_at` Incremental Replication.

To do this, you can use the `{{ system-column.sequence }}` column and the table's Primary Key. The `{{ system-column.sequence }}` is a Unix epoch (down to the millisecond) attached to the record during replication and can help determine the order of all the versions of a row.

**Note:** If you didn't define a Primary Key while setting up the integration, the Primary Key for the table will be `{{ system-column.primary-key }}`.

If you wanted to create a snapshot of the latest version of this table, you could run a query like this:

```sql
SELECT * FROM [stitch-redshift:stitch-{{ integration.name | remove: "." | replace: " ", "" }}.data] o
INNER JOIN (
    SELECT
        MAX({{ system-column.sequence }}) AS seq,
        {{ webhook-primary-key }}
    FROM [stitch-redshift:stitch-{{ integration.name | replace: " ", "" }}.data]
    GROUP BY {{ webhook-primary-key }}) oo
ON o.{{ webhook-primary-key }} = oo.{{ webhook-primary-key }}
AND o.{{ system-column.sequence }} = oo.seq
```

This approach uses a subquery to get a single list of every row's Primary Key and maximum sequence number. It then joins the original table to both the Primary Key and maximum sequence, which makes all other column values available for querying.
