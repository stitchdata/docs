### Define the Primary Key {#define-webhook-primary-key}

Next, you’ll define the Primary Key for the data that your {{ integration.display_name }} integration will send to your data warehouse. A Primary Key is a field that’s used to uniquely identify each message in the webhook data.

Primary Keys must:

- Uniquely identify each message in the webhook data
- Have field names with 50 or less characters
- Be top-level fields. This means that Primary Key fields can't be part of a nested object or array. 

  If you need help determining if a field is part of a top-level record, we recommend looking for examples of the JSON record in your app's API documentation. We're always happy to help if you still aren't sure.

#### Primary Keys and Replication Methods

{% include integrations/webhooks/primary-keys-replication.html %}

**Additionally, we don't recommend changing a Primary Key once the integration has been set up and data has replicated.** This could result in fields not being updated properly.

#### Enter the Primary Key into Stitch

In the **Primary Key** field, enter the name of the field you want to use as a Primary Key. Note that this field isn’t required, but if left blank Stitch will auto-generate a Primary Key instead.
