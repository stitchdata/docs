<!-- For table types -->
{% if include.type == "table-types" %}
There are two types of tables in Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration: Core Object and Report.

- **Core Object** tables contain foundational data that's useful for analysis. These are the [`accounts`](#accounts), [`ad_groups`](#ad_groups), [`ads`](#ads), and [`campaigns`](#campaigns) tables. {{ core-object-replication }}

- **Report** tables are the various {{ integration.display_name }} reports. The replication process for these tables is a bit unlike that of other tables:
  - **Extraction**: Data is extracted using a {{ window }}. A {{ window }} is a period of time after a customer clicks an ad that a conversion (ex: a purchase) is recorded in {{ integration.display_name }}. Stitch currently uses a {{ window }} of **{{ integration.attribution-window }}**.

     This means that data from the past {{ integration.attribution-window }} will be replicated during every replication job.
  - **Loading**: Data is loaded into your data warehouse using Append-Only Replication.

For **Report** tables, this means that:

1. **Due to the {{ window }}, a high Replication Frequency may not be necessary.** Because Stitch will replicate data from the past {{ integration.attribution-window }} during every replication job, recent data will be re-replicated and count towards your row quota.

   To help prevent overages or unnecessary re-replication, consider setting the integration to sync less frequently. For example: every 12 or 24 hours.

2. **Querying for the latest data in Report tables will require a different strategy than you might usually use**. Stitch will add a column named `{{ system-column.report-date-time }}` to Report tables to help you identify the most recent records in a table. [See the Query for the Latest Data section for more info and a sample query](#query-for-the-latest-data).

Each part of the replication process for **Report** tables is explained below.
{% endif %}



<!-- For Report Tables -->
{% if include.type == "report-tables" %}
{% unless integration.name == "facebook-ads" %}
Every time Stitch runs a replication job for {{ integration.display_name }}, the last {{ integration.attribution-window }}' worth of data will be replicated for any [**Report** tables](#schema) currently being tracked.

Stitch replicates data in this way to account for updates made during the {{ window }}.
{% endunless %}

{% include integrations/saas/attribution-window-examples.html %}

{% endif %}



<!-- For data loading -->
{% if include.type == "data-loading" %}
When Stitch loads the extracted data {% unless integration.name == "doubleclick-campaign-manager" %}for Report tables {% endunless %}into your destination, it will do so using Append-Only Replication. This is a type of Incremental Replication where existing rows aren't updated, but appended to the end of the table. 

Additionally, the number of rows loaded into the table during each replication job is dependent on the combination of unique values in the dimension columns you track. See the [Column Selection and Statistic Aggregation section](#column-selection-statistic-aggregation) for more info and examples.

##### Example {#append-only-example}

Let's say these columns are tracking in the `{{ table }}` table:

{% if integration.name == "doubleclick-campaign-manager" %}
- `{{ replication-key }}` (dimension) - The date pertaining to the record.
{% endif %}
- `campaignId` (dimension) - This is the ID associated with a campaign. In this example, there are two campaigns: `929007494` and `929599581`
- `{{ device }}` (dimension) - The device type. There are two values for this example: `Computer` and `Tablet`
- `impressions` (metric) - The total number of impressions.

Every time Stitch replicates and loads data, a row for each unique combination of the dimension columns will be appended to the end of the table:

| {{ system-column.report-date-time }} | {{ replication-key }} | {{ account-id }} | campaignId | {{ device }} | impressions |
|---------------------------------|--------------------------------------|------------|-----|--------|-------------|
| 2017-10-01 17:48:26.791 | 2017-09-10 00:00:00 | {{ account-id-data }} | 929007494 | Computer                  | 61 |
| 2017-10-01 17:48:26.791 | 2017-09-10 00:00:00 | {{ account-id-data }} | 929007494 | Tablet                    | 15 |
| 2017-10-01 17:48:26.791 | 2017-09-10 00:00:00 | {{ account-id-data }} | 929599581 | Computer                  | 37 |
| 2017-10-01 17:48:26.791 | 2017-09-10 00:00:00 | {{ account-id-data }} | 929599581 | Tablet                    | 9  |
{% endif %}



<!-- For append-only query -->
{% if include.type == "append-only-query" %}
{% capture query-foundation %}
The query below is meant to act as a foundation for writing your own. Depending on your SQL syntax and the dimensions contained in a given table, you may need to alter this query for your own usage.

When querying your {{ integration.display_name }} data, you'll want to include the Dimensions you're analyzing in the partition. For example: If you're analyzing campaigns over time, you'd include columns like `campaignId` and `date`.
{% endcapture %}

{% include note.html first-line="**You may need to alter this query**" content=query-foundation %}

If you want only the most recently replicated data for any {{ integration.display_name }} {% unless integration.name == "doubleclick-campaign-manager" %}Report {% endunless %}table, you can use the sample query below to account for the Append-Only Replication Stitch uses.

{% case integration.name %}
{% when 'doubleclick-campaign-manager' %}
{% assign replication-key = "dimension_1, dimension_2, etc." %}

This query will use the report's Dimensions and the `{{ system-column.report-date-time }}` column to return the latest data:

{% else %}
This query uses two columns - which are automatically included for every Report table - to return the latest data:

- `{{ replication-key }}` - The day that the record pertains to.
- `{{ system-column.report-date-time }}` - The starting time of the Stitch job that extracted the record.
{% endcase %}

```sql
SELECT *
  FROM (
        SELECT *,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY {{ replication-key }}{{ customerid | prepend: ", " }}
                     ORDER BY {{ system-column.report-date-time }} DESC)
        FROM {{ table }}
        ORDER BY {{ replication-key }} ASC
       ) AS latest
 WHERE latest.rank = 1
```

In this query:

1. [A subquery first uses a window function](https://chartio.com/resources/tutorials/using-window-functions/) to create a 'window' of data for each {% case integration.name %}{% when 'google-adwords %}`{{ replication-key }}` and `{{ customerid }}` combination{% when 'doubleclick-campaign-manager' %} combination of Dimensions{% else %} `{{ replication-key }}`{% endcase %},
2. The values of the `{{ system-column.report-date-time }}` column are ranked within each window partition, and
4. Then, in the outer query, only the rows with `{{ system-column.report-date-time }}` values ranked as `1` - which is equal to the maximum timestamp - are returned.
