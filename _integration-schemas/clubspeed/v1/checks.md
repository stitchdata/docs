  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about checks, or financial invoices, that have been closed.
  
  {% capture replication-note %}
  **Note**: This table uses `{{ replication-keys | strip }}` as the [Replication Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This means that checks will not be selected for replication until the record has a `{{ replication-keys | strip }}` value, which should occur when the check has a `status` of `closed`.
