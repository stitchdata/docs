  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about line items and quantity info attached to [`checks`](#checks).

  {% capture replication-tip %}
  **Note**: This table uses `{{ replication-keys | strip }}` as the [Replication Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This means that check details will be selected for replication only when they are initially created. Any subsequent updates made to the check detail will not be detected, as the `{{ replication-keys | strip }}` value will not be updated. Refer to the [Key-based Incremental Replication documentation]({{ link.replication.key-based-incremental | prepend: site.baseurl }}) for more info and examples.
