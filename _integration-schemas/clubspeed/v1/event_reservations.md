  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about event reservations, which are linked to [`events`](#events).
  
  {% capture replication-note %}
  **Note**: This table uses `{{ replication-keys | strip }}` as the [Replication Key]({{ link.replication.rep-keys | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This means that unless an event reservation's `startTime` is updated, changes to event reservation records will not be selected for replication.
