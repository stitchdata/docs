  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains pairs of user IDs and project task IDs.

   This data can be used to see lists of all the project tasks associated with a user, and join tables together to get a comprehensive look at the user's projects.
  
  **Note**: This table is updated based on new and updated `users`. This means that when a user is updated, this table will also be updated.
