  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains metadata about the activity types - form fill, web page visit, lead creation, and so on - available in {{ integration.display_name }}.

# notes: |
#   #### Filter Deleted Leads
#   When joined with the `activities` table, you can use specific activity types to filter out deleted leads, assess list membership, and more. Here are a few noteworthy activity types:

#   - **Add to List and Remove from List** - These events can be used to discover lead list membership.
#   - **Delete Lead** - A `delete lead` event indicates leads that have been deleted. We recommend using this activity to filter out deleted leads.
#   - **Add a Lead to a Nurture Program, Change Nurture Track, and Change Nurture Cadence** - These events can help you determine what nurture programs a lead is in and lead activity against that program.
