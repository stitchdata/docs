  In [version 1.0 of Stitch's Marketo integration]({{ site.baseurl }}/integrations/saas/{{ integration.name }}-v1), the `activities` table contained all data pertaining to lead activities.

  In this version, you can choose to replicate lead activity data for specific activity types. For every activity type defined in your {{ integration.display_name }} account, you'll see an `{{ table.name }}` table in the {{ app.buttons.tables }} tab. For example: `activities_click_email` contains lead activity data for the `click_email` activity type.

  These tables will contain the fields listed below, along with any fields specific to that activity type.
