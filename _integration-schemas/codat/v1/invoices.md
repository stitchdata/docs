      The status of the invoice. Possible values are:

      - `Draft` - Invoice has not been submitted to the Supplier. It may be in a pending state or is scheduled for future submission e.g. via email.
      - `Submitted` - Invoice is no longer a draft and has been sent to the Supplier. In this state, no payments have been made against the invoice (amountDue == totalAmount).
      - `PartiallyPaid` - The balance paid against the invoice is positive, but less than the total invoice amount (0 < amountDue < totalAmount).
      - `Paid` - Invoice is paid in full. This includes if the Invoice has been credited or overpaid (amountDue == 0).
      -` Void` - An invoice can become Void by being deleted, refunded, written off, or cancelled. Note, a voided Invoice may still be partiallyPaid and so all outstanding amounts on voided Inovices are removed from the AR (Accounts Receivable) account.
