  This is an example of a table created from a sheet you set to replicate.

  For every sheet you set to replicate, Stitch will create a corresponding table in your destination. The table will contain the columns you select in Stitch, along with a few columns Stitch requires for replication.
  
  Refer to the [Data replication](#extraction--data-replication) section for more info about how this table replicates.
