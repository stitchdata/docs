  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains a list of tag statistics since the last completed replication job through the most recent iteration of the defined [**Incremental Range**](#add-stitch-data-source) (day or hour).

  This table will include tags in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

  **Note**: During the historical replication job, all increments (defined using the **Incremental Range** setting) since the **Start Date** will be replicated. This will result in the first record for this table being an aggregated record across all tags.
