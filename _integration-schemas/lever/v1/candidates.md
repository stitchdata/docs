  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about candidates, or individuals who've been added to your {{ integration.display_name }} account as potential fits for job opportunities.

  **Note**: This table must be set to replicate in order to replicate the `candidate_applications`, `candidate_offers`, `candidate_referrals`, and `candidate_resumes` tables.

  During Extraction, this table will be replicated before any other selected `candidate_*` tables. Then, for every candidate, Stitch will query for every candidate's applications, offers, referrals, and resumes.

  For example: During Extraction, Stitch replicates a candidate with `id: 12345` from {{ integration.display_name }}'s `/candidates` endpoint.

  Using `id: 12345`, Stitch will then query for the rest of the candidate's data:

  - `/candidates/12345/applications`
  - `/candidates/12345/offers`
  - `/candidates/12345/referrals`
  - `/candidates/12345/resumes`
