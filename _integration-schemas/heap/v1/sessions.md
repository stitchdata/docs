  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about sessions. In {{ integration.display_name }}, a web session ends after 30 minutes of user inactivity, while in iOS, a session ends after the app has entered the background.

  **Note**: Custom attributes are supported for this table. As {{ integration.display_name }} schemas are dynamic, Stitch's `{{ table.name }}` documentation will only list the non-custom attributes outlined in {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation.
