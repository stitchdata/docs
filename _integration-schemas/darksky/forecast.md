description: |
  The `forecasts` table contains weather conditions for a particular date and location. The locations are determined by the locations entered into the **Locations** field in Stitch.
  
  **Note**: The units data points are returned in is determined by the value entered into the **Units** field in Stitch. For example: If `us` is entered, data will be returned in Imperial units.
