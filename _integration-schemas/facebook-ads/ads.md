  The `ads` table contains info about the ads in your Facebook Ads account.

  **This is a Core Object table**.

  #### updated_time and querying

  Because this table uses `updated_time` as part of the Primary Key, query results might return various versions of the same adgroup.

  To reflect the latest state of the adgroup, use the latest `updated_time` timestamp.

  #### Deleted ads

  If the **Include data from deleted campaigns, ads, and adsets** box in the integration's settings is checked, this table will include data for deleted ads.

      Targeting specs are ad set attributes that define who sees an ad.

      Stitch may create subtables named `ads__targeting__[spec_name]` for each targeting spec type that is applied to the ad set. For example: `ads__targeting__life_events`

      If you have many targeting specs applied to ads, a large number of subtables may be created in your destination.
