  The `ads` table contains info about the ads in your Facebook Ads account.

  **This is a Core Object table**.

  #### updated_time & Querying
  Because this table uses `updated_time` as part of the Primary Key, query results might return various versions of the same adgroup.

  To reflect the latest state of the adgroup, use the latest `updated_time` timestamp.

  #### Deleted Ads
  If the **Include data from deleted campaigns, ads, and adsets** box in the integration's settings is checked, this table will include data for deleted ads.

      Targeting specs are ad set attributes that define who sees an ad.

      Stitch may create subtables named `ads__targeting__[spec_name]` for each targeting spec type that is applied to the ad set. For example: `ads__targeting__life_events`

    description: |
      Tracking specs are actions taken by people interacting with the ad. **Note**: tracking specs only **track** - they don't optimize or charge based on that action occurring.

      Stitch may create subtables named named `ads__tracking_specs__[spec_type]` for any tracking spec type applied to the ad. Subtables are created for any tracking spec type.

      If you have applied many tracking specs to your ads, this will result in a large number of subtables in your data warehouse. [Refer to Facebook's documentation for a full list of tracking specs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/conversion-action-query/).

      Subtables created for tracking specs will, in general, have the following schema:
    array-attributes:
      - name: |
          {{ system-column.level-id | replace: "#", "1" }}
        type: "integer"
        primary-key: true
        description: |
          This column functions the same as the `{{ system-column.level-id | replace: "#", "0" }}` column.

      - name: "value"
        type: "string"
        description: "The value for the tracking spec."

  - name: "conversion_specs"
    type: "array"
    description: |
      Conversion specs allow Facebook to surface the ad to users most likely to perform a desired decision. For example: adding to a shopping cart, viewing a particular page, or completing a form.
    doc-link: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/conversion-action-query/
    array-attributes:
      - name: |
          {{ system-column.level-id | replace: "#", "1" }}
        type: "integer"
        primary-key: true
        description: |
          This column functions the same as the `{{ system-column.level-id | replace: "#", "0" }}` column.

      - name: "value"
        type: "string"
        description: |
          Depending on the conversion specs you've applied to the ad, if any, Stitch may create subtables for each spec type. Subtables that are created will be named `ads__conversion_specs__[spec_type]`

          Aside from the columns listed in this subtable (`_sdc_level_0_id`, `_sdc_source_key_id`, etc), these tables will contain a field named `value`.

          Stitch will create a subtable for any conversion spec type. If you have applied many conversion specs, this will result in a large number of subtables in your data warehouse.

          [Refer to Facebook's documentation for a full list of conversion specs](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/marketing-api/reference/conversion-action-query/).
