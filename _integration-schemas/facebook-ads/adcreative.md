              Details about the native deeplinks attached to the post. 

              Stitch will replicate data for the following deeplink types:

              - [`android`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/android-app-link/)
              - [`ios`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/ios-app-link/)

              - [`iphone`](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/ios-app-link/)

              **Note**: Depending on your data warehouse, a subtable for each deeplink type may be created. For example: For a type of `android`, a table named `adcreative__object_story_spec__link_data__app_link_spec__android` will be created.
