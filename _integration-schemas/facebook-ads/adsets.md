  The `adsets` table contains info about the Ad Sets in your Facebook Ads account.

  **This is a Core Object table**.

  #### updated_time & Querying

  Because this table uses `updated_time` as part of the Primary Key, query results might return various versions of the same adgroup. 

  To reflect the latest state of the adgroup, use the latest `updated_time` timestamp.

  #### Deleted Adsets
  If the **Include data from deleted campaigns, ads, and adsets** box in the integration's settings is checked, this table will include data for deleted adsets.
