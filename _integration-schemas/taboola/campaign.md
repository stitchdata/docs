  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the campaigns in your Taboola account.

  #### Replication

  During every replication job, all campaigns in your Taboola account will be extracted, or "fully replicated." If you look in the [Extraction Logs]({{ link.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl }}) in the Stitch app, you'll see lines like this:

  ```
  2017-10-25 13:46:52,254Z tap - INFO Synced 100 campaigns.
  2017-10-25 13:46:52,255Z tap - INFO Done syncing campaigns.
  ```

  Roughly the same amount of campaigns should be extracted during every job, unless brand new campaigns are added between jobs.

  When Stitch loads the extracted records into your destination, however, only new and updated campaigns will be loaded. **This means that only new and updated campaign records will count towards your row count**.

  #### Deleted campaigns

  Currently, [the Singer tap](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-taboola){:target="new"} powering this integration has no way to account for campaigns that are hard-deleted in {{ integration.display_name }}. This means that if a campaign is deleted at the source, the record for that campaign will remain in the destination.

  #### NULL dates

  On occasion, {{ integration.display_name }}'s API will push `NULL` for `start_date` and `999-12-31` for `end_date`. [The Singer tap](https://github.com/singer-io/tap-taboola#gotchas){:target="new"} behind this integration will convert `NULL` dates to `999-12-31` for consistency.
