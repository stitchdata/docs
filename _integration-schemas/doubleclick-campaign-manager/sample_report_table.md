  For each report you set to replicate, Stitch will create a table in your destination. The name of the report will be the name of the destination table, with some light transformations to ensure the table name adheres to your destination's naming rules.

  For example: A report named `Ad Performance Report` in {{ integration.display_name }} may result in a table named `ad_performance_report` or `AD_PERFORMANCE_REPORT`, depending on your destination.

replication-method: "Append-Only (Incremental)"
