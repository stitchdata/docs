  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about resource metafields. These are arbitrary fields used to store additional information about resources.

  #### Metafield replication and resource types {#metafield-replication-and-resources}

  **By default, this table will include only shop-level metafield data**. To replicate the metafields for a given resource type, this table and the table for the resource must be set to replicate.

  For example: To replicate metafield data for Orders, the `orders` table must also be set to replicate.

  Metafield data is available for [`customers`](#customers), [`products`](#products), and [`orders`](#orders).
