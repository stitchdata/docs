  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the tasks in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

  #### Custom fields

  To replicate task custom fields, select the `custom_fields` attribute in Stitch. If your destination doesn't natively support nested data structures, two subtables (`tasks__custom_fields`, `tasks__custom_fields__enum_options`) will be created.

          From {{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation:

          > 0 is integer values, 1 rounds to the nearest tenth, and so on. Must be between 0 and 6, inclusive. For percentage format, this may be unintuitive, as a value of 0.25 has a precision of 0, while a value of 0.251 has a precision of 1. This is due to 0.25 being displayed as 25%. The identifier format will always have a precision of 0.
