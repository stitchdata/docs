  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about linked transactions. Linked transactions are transactions where line items from a purchase transaction to a customer are linked to a sales transaction.

# Use the UpdatedDateUTC field (formatted as an rfc3339 string) as a bookmark. Since this API endpoint does not support filtering by UpdatedDateUTC within a request, the Tap should request all data for this endpoint and filter out entries with earlier update_at values before writing out records, and write out a bookmark value corresponding to the greatest UpdatedDateUTC value it encounters.

# Unclear if this will count towards row usage.
