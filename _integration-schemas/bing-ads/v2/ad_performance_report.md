  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains performance info about ads, including clicks and conversions. This data can be used to identify and improve under-performing ads.

  [This is a **Report** table](#replication). See the **Replication** section for information on how data is replicated and loaded for this table.

  #### Columns renamed from Bing Ads v1 {#renamed-v1-columns}

  In this version of Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration, some columns have been re-named. This was done to ensure consistency between the fields in our integration and [the changes made by Microsoft to the Bing Ads API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingads/guides/migration-guide?view=bingads-12#reporting-downloadedcolumns){:target="new}.

  - `FinalAppURL` is now `FinalAppUrl`
  - `FinalURL` is now `FinalUrl`
  - `FinalMobileURL` is now `FinalMobileUrl`
