  #### Column compatibility

  As per Microsoft's attribute selection rules, some columns may be incompatible. This means that you won't be able to select certain combinations of columns in Stitch. Refer to [Microsoft's documentation](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingads/guides/reports?view=bingads-12#columnrestrictions){:target="new"} for more info, and the specific column combinations for this table.

  #### Columns renamed from Bing Ads v1 {#renamed-v1-columns}

  In this version of Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration, some columns have been re-named. This was done to ensure consistency between the fields in our integration and [the changes made by Microsoft to the Bing Ads API](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/bingads/guides/migration-guide?view=bingads-12#reporting-downloadedcolumns){:target="new}.
