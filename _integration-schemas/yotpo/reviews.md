  The `reviews` table contains data about reviews.

  **Note**: This table is similar to the `product_reviews` table, but doesn't contain custom fields. If you have or need custom fields, you may want to only replicate the `product_reviews` table to prevent redundant data.

  #### Attribution window {#review-attribution-window}

  When Stitch replicates data for this table, it will use an attribution window of {{ integration.attribution-window }} to fetch updated (or deleted) reviews. This means that every time a replication job runs, the last 30 days' worth of data will be replicated for this table.

  Refer to the [Replication](#replication) section for more info and examples of how the attribution window is used to query for data.
