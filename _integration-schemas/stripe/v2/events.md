  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about [events](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events){:target="new"}. When an  event occurs, a new event object is created. This table acts as the history of an object, allowing you to see how it has changed over time.

  For example: When an invoice is created, an `invoice.created` event is created. When the draft invoice is finalized and updated to be open, an `invoice.finalized` event is created. When the invoice is sent to the customer, an `invoice.sent` event is created.

  For more info about this table and how data is replicated, refer to the [Replication](#replication) section. Additionally, refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"} for info about event types and the objects they describe.
