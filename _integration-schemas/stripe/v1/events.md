  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about [events](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events){:target="new"}. When an  event occurs, a new event object is created. This table acts as the history of an object, allowing you to see how it has changed over time.

  For example: When an invoice is created, an `invoice.created` event is created. When the draft invoice is finalized and updated to be open, an `invoice.finalized` event is created. When the invoice is sent to the customer, an `invoice.sent` event is created.

  For more info about this table and how data is replicated, refer to the [Replication](#replication) section. Additionally, refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s documentation](https://stripe.com/docs/api/events/types){:target="new"} for info about event types and the objects they describe.

      This object contains details about the event, relevant to the event's `type`.

      For example: For an `invoice.*` event, this will be a full [invoice object](#invoices). Refer to the object's dedicated table (ex: [`invoices`](#invoices)) for a list of possible attributes.

      **Note**: To join specific events with the corresponding object record, this attribute must be set to replicate. It contains the object's `id`, which is necessary to join events to objects correctly.
