  The `email_events` table contains info about email events and how recipients interact with content.

  #### Email events and HubSpot permissions

  Replicating this table requires **Super Admin** permissions in HubSpot. The Super Admin role is different than the Admin role, which you can read more about in [HubSpot's documentation](https://knowledge.hubspot.com/articles/kcs_article/settings/hubspot-user-roles-guide#admin).

  If this table is selected and you don't have Super Admin permissions in HubSpot, an error similar to the following will surface in the integration's [Extraction Logs]({{ link.replication.extraction-logs | prepend: site.baseurl }}):

  ```
  tap - ERROR b'{"status":"error","message":"This oauth-token (**********) does not have proper permissions! (requires any of [email-access])", [...]
  ```
