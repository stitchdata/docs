  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the manufacturing routing templates in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

  A manufacturing routing is a template that contains a list of steps required to build an assembly item. Each step is in a sequential order necessary to complete the operational sequence for completing the assembly. After you have created a routing record, that routing can be selected on a work order to direct the completion of the assembly. The routing determines the work center, cost template, labor resources, and machine resources that will be used during the assembly.
