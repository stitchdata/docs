  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the billing schedules in your {{ integration.display_name }} account. Billing schedules are used to define how bills for transactions are relayed to customers. In general, a billing schedule determines the frequency with which the customer is billed and the amount of each bill. However, the exact effect of a billing schedule varies depending on its type.
