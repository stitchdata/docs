  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the classifications in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

  As classifications inherit the permissions set on the parent record, the permissions required for the parent record are required to access classification data.

  For example: To get classification data for a location, the user must have the permission for accessing location data.

## Refer to _data/extraction/netsuite/netsuite-permissions.yml for permissions for this table/object.
