  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the worklogs in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

  **Note**: For a worklog to be replicated, it must be set as `Viewable by All Users`, or the integration [authenticating user]() (visible in the integration's {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page), must be a member of the project role/group with permission to view the worklog.

  If you're missing worklogs, verify that you have the required permissions to access the worklog.

## There are two different endpoints we use to get worklogs:

## 1. Get IDs of updated worklogs - only returns (you guessed it!) IDs of modified worklogs. As it returns only the worklog ID, we need to get the body details elsewhere. So we use:

## 2. Get worklogs (https://developer.atlassian.com/cloud/jira/platform/rest/v2/#api-api-2-worklog-list-post) - We request the data for the worklog IDs we retrieved in Step 1.
