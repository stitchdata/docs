  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the projects in your {{ integration.display_name }} account.

  **Note**: Stitch will only replicate data from the projects that the user whose credentials are [authenticating the integration](#add-stitch-data-source) can access. If there are missing projects, verify that the authenticating user (found in the integration's {{ app.page-names.int-settings }} page) has access to the missing projects.
