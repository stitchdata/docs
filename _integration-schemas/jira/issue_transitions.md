  #### Replication requirements {#replication-requirements-issue-transitions}

  To replicate this data:

  1. The [`issues`](#issues) table must also be set to replicate. **Note**: When an issue is updated, all the transitions for that issue will also be replicated.
   2. The `Browse Projects` [project {{ integration.display_name }} permission]({{ integration.project-permissions-doc }}){:target="new"} is required. Refer to [{{ integration.display_name }}'s API documentation]({{ table.doc-link }}){:target="new"} for more info.
