  The `conversations` table contains info about user conversations, or conversations initiated by your end-users.

  #### Conversation Parts
  To reconstruct an entire conversation, use the `conversation_parts` associated with the conversation. These are the individual elements - actions, messages, and so on - that make up a conversation.

  If your warehouse doesn't natively support nested data structures, a subtable named `conversations__conversation_parts` will be created. More info on this table can be found below.
