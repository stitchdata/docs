  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about companies that use your {{ integration.display_name }} product.

  #### Custom attributes {#company-custom-attributes}

  If applicable, Stitch will replicate custom fields related to `{{ table.name }}` in {{ integration.display_name }}.

  #### Limitations {#company-limitations}

  [{{ integration.display_name }}'s API limits the number of simultaneous requests]({{ table.api-method.doc-link }}){:target="new"} a single {{ integration.display_name }} app, or connection, can make to the {{ table.api-method.name }} endpoint. Stitch uses this endpoint to replicate company data. Currently, only one request can occur at a time.

  If multiple connections exist and they attempt to use this endpoint at the same time, only the connection who made the request first will succeed.

  This means that if Stitch attempts to extract data when another connection is using the endpoint, Extraction will fail and an [error](TODO) will surface in the Extraction Logs.

  To prevent or minimize this issue, we recommend limiting the number of connections a single workspace has or scheduling extraction jobs in Stitch around your other connections' usage.
