  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains "raw data dumps" of tracked events.

  #### Table schema {#export-events-table-schema}

  The schema for this table is dynamic, meaning that the columns Stitch detects are dependent upon the properties provided upon upload in {{ integration.display_name }}. For every property available in {{ integration.display_name }} for `{{ table.name }}` records, Stitch will display a column in the integration's **Tables to Replicate** tab.

  #### Replication with attribution window {#export-events-attribution-window}

  This table is replicated using the **Attribution Window** value defined in the integration's settings page. Refer to the [Replication section](#attribution-windows-extraction) for more info.

  #### Distinct events and loading behavior {#export-events-loading-behavior}

  As Stitch doesn't use a Primary Key for this table, data will be loaded using [Append-Only loading]({{ link.destinations.storage.loading-behavior | prepend: site.baseurl }}). This means you may see duplicate records in your destination, which requires a querying strategy that selects the latest version of each record.

  Stitch takes this approach because it's possible to track events without a `distinct_id`. In {{ integration.display_name }}, `distinct_id` [is used to identify a unique user](https://help.mixpanel.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004509406-Distinct-IDs-){:target="new"}:

  > Mixpanelâ€™s client-side tracking libraries automatically assign a distinct_id to a user when they first visit a website or an application that has Mixpanel installed. Distinct_id should not contain any special characters such as forward slashes, as it will break the URL.
  > Distinct_ids can and often should be sent in server-side implementations as well.

  In order for Stitch to replicate records' `distinct_id` attributes, your server-side {{ integration.display_name }} implementation must send them with tracked events. If the server-side implementation doesn't do this, this attribute will be `null`.

  Previous versions of Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration used `distinct_id` as part of a composite Primary Key for this table. However, due to the possibility of this attribute being `null`, Stitch no longer uses a Primary Key for this table, as `null` values in Primary Key columns will prevent successful Extraction. 

  When working with `exports` data in your destination, you'll need to use a querying strategy that accounts for the Append-Only loading used by this table. We recommend using the following columns to de-duplicate records, along with the approach outlined in the [Querying Append-Only tables guide]({{ link.replication.append-only-querying | prepend: site.baseurl }}):

  - `distinct_id`
  - `event`
  - `time`

      When analzying this table's data, we recommend using this column, `distinct_id`, and `event`, along with a [querying strategy for Append-Only tables]({{ link.replication.append-only-querying | prepend: site.baseurl }}) to de-duplicate records. Refer to the [table description](#export-events-loading-behavior) for more info.

Refer to the [table description](#export-events-loading-behavior) for more info.
