  The `{{ table.name }}` table contains info about the users associated with your {{ integration.display_name }} account. This includes agents, admins, and end-users (customers).

  **Note**: Retrieving user data requires {{ integration.display_name }} Admin permissions.

  #### Custom user fields {#customer-user-fields}

  Stitch's {{ integration.display_name }} integration will replicate any custom fields associated with user records.

  **Note**: Replicating user custom fields requires that you be on a Team, Professional, or Enterprise {{ integration.display_name }} plan.
