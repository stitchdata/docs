  The `group_memberships` table contains info about the groups your Zendesk agents are members of.

  **Note**: Retrieving group membership data requires Zendesk Agent or Admin permissions.

  #### Deleted group memberships

  As Zendesk's API doesn't currently provide a method for identifying deleted group memberships, we recommend periodically dropping this table and allowing Stitch to re-create it. Currently, dropping and re-populating the table is the only way to detect deletions.
