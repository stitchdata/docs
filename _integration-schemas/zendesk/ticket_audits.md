  **Note**: This table uses Append-Only Incremental Replication. This means that new audit records, or updates made to existing audits, are appended as new rows to the end of the table.

  The `ticket_audits` table contains info about the activity associated with a ticket. An audit is a history of all updates to a given ticket. When a ticket is updated in Zendesk, an audit record is created. Each audit represents a single update to a ticket.

  A single audit record may include multiple event types. For example: A ticket comment, satisfaction rating, and a change event. For a full list of Zendesk audit event types, [refer to Zendesk's documentation](https://developer.zendesk.com/rest_api/docs/core/ticket_audits#audit-events).
