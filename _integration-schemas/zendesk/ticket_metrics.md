  The `ticket_metrics` table contains info about the metrics associated with Zendesk tickets. **Note**: This table will not include records for deleted tickets.

  **Note**: Retrieving ticket metric data requires Zendesk Admin permissions.

  #### Deleted ticket metrics
  As Zendesk's API doesn't currently support returning metrics for deleted tickets, this table will not contain any metrics for deleted tickets.

  If you believe you're missing records, check in your Zendesk account to see if the missing records are for deleted tickets.
  
  For more info on how Zendesk handles deleting tickets, [refer to their documentation](https://support.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203690936).
